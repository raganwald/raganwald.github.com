					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Richard Hamming on <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/%7Erobins/YouAndYourResearch.html">solving important problems</a>:<br /><blockquote>In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person. I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do first-class work.'' Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, <span style="font-style: italic;">why shouldn't you set out to do something significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, ``Yes, I would like to do something significant.''</span></blockquote>This, in my experience, is the whole story. Everything else falls out of this personal commitment. It's a commitment to try. To strive. To sweat. To make the effort. To care.<br /><br />Without this commitment, you have made a de facto decision to be on the receiving end of life. To float down the river like a leaf, now hither, now thither, carried by currents and wind.<br /><br />Drop the modesty. There's nothing wrong with wanting to do something great, even insanely great.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">But I'm forty-two going on forty-three...</span><br /><p></p> <blockquote>   <p>Age is another factor which the physicists particularly worry about. They always are saying that <a href="http://paulgraham.com/start.html">you have got to do it when you are young</a> or you will never do it. Einstein did things very early, and all the quantum mechanic fellows were disgustingly young when they did their best work. Most mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and astrophysicists do what we consider their best work when they are young. It is not that they don't do good work in their old age but what we value most is often what they did early. On the other hand, in music, politics and literature, often what we consider their best work was done late. I don't know how whatever field you are in fits this scale, but age has some effect. </p>    <p>But let me say why age seems to have the effect it does. <span style="font-style: italic;">In the first place  if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and  unable to do any more work</span>... When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you.<br /></p> </blockquote>In my own experience, having some modest success early opens doors. But do they lead in the right direction? Sometimes not. I am constantly getting offers to manage teams of programmers working on uninteresting applications. I have taken such jobs, and I can say with certainty that while I have been successful most of the time and <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/2005/01/what-ive-learned-from-failure.html">unsuccessful</a> some of the time, uninteresting projects have never magically transformed themselves into important work.<br /><br />It's hard to plant acorns when you've grown an oak. But it's necessary, very necessary. You can't get buried in management meetings and UML diagrams and presentations to resellers (you especially can't even get buried in writing about software development).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Todd Proebsting</span><br /><br />A few years ago I went to a conference at MIT called "<a href="http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/">Lightweight Languages 2</a>." All sorts of very bright people were there. Joe Armstrong gave a talk on Erlang. Matz gave a talk on Ruby. And a charismatic speaker from Microsoft named Todd Proebsting gave a talk about Disruptive Language Technologies.<br /><br />In his talk, he gave a story about Richard Hamming. And here's the same story, in Richard's own words:<br /><blockquote>Over on the other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table. I had worked with one of the fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting our secretary at the time. I went over and said, ``Do you mind if I join you?'' They can't say no, so I started eating with them for a while. And I started asking, ``<span style="font-style: italic;">What are  the important problems of your field?</span>'' And after a week or so, ``<span style="font-style: italic;">What important  problems are you working on?</span>'' And after some more time I came in one day and  said, ``<span style="font-style: italic;">If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?</span>''  I wasn't welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with! That was  in the spring.</blockquote>So...<br /><ul>   <li>What is the most important problem in your area of interest?</li>   <li>What are you working on?</li>   <li>Why aren't they the same?<br /></li> </ul><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/labels/jobs.html">jobs</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/labels/passion.html">passion</a></p>&nbsp;

								<a name="111466754695175697"></a> 				This doesn't just apply to research - or science or code.<BR/><BR/>The three questions you ask are also very important in business.<BR/><BR/>*  What is the most important problem in your area of interest? OR What is <I>THE</I> benefit that clients are looking for that you can potentially offer?<BR/>* What are you working on? OR What is the core focus of your business?  What needs do your products and services fill?<BR/>* Why aren't they the same?<BR/><BR/>In business the answer to the first question isn't always earth-shattering or NEW - and doesn't always lead to major advancements or paradigm shifts - BUT, if you can answer the question, and really focus on filling that need or providing that benefit, it shows that you care enough to understand your customers, care about what you do, and, in the end, shows you and your business are capable of making a valuable contribution.<BR/><BR/>All of these are rewards on their own, but surely come with some financial rewards as well.<BR/><BR/>andre<br />

								<a name="111478158086056519"></a> 				Regarding The Role of Age<BR/><BR/>The thing is, you can break occupations down into two groups:<BR/>1) Those in which innovation is of utmost importance (science, technology, marketing)<BR/>2) Those in which experience is of utmost importance (politics, music)<BR/><BR/>Only when you understand the world can you be a truly great politician - and this does not come quickly - so most great politicians are older.<BR/><BR/>Only when your mind is not trapped by preconceptions can you innovate in science. You have to be able to believe in something that everyone says is impossible - and that's much easier when you're younger and haven't yet become as jaded as some become. Also, youth and lack of knowledge afford the ability to approach a problem from a completely new angle - an angle so unique that it could only have been produced by that individual, in those circumstances, at that age, and in that age.<br />

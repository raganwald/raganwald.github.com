For that reason, you have to sell the holes themselves, not the technology for making them.<br /><br />It's a mistake to 'sell' DSLs, just as it's a mistake to sell metaprogramming. Wherever programmers <a href="http://programming.reddit.com">hang out</a>, you'll find people arguing the merits of high signal-to-noise techniques like DSLs. It's fun and instructive to have this debate, <span style="font-style: italic;">but it isn't selling</span>. It's coffee-shop banter about drill bits, and whether diamond tips are worth the price, and are all carpenters equal or are some better than others, and should all drills have safeties so any monkey can make holes, and can you do concurrent drilling with a drill press framework?<br /><br />Lots of people love the way Ruby on Rails makes certain things declarative and makes their code smaller than whatever else they used to use. They love the <span style="font-style: italic;">holes</span>, and that's as it should be. DSLs and metaprogramming are implementation details for framework builders, not selling features for framework <span style="font-style: italic;">users</span>.<br /><br />At least, not up front. Later, after they've gotten hooked on drilling holes, they'll be interested in drill technology. :-)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

As Joel Spolsky said, <A HREF="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html" REL="nofollow">most abstractions leak</A>. It is therefore crucial to be able to look behind the scenes. This is a lot easier of your DSL is a compiler rather than an interpreter and, in particular, if it compiles to the very language you are already familiar with. Languages that make this possible have a distinct advantage here. (See my <A HREF="http://peomeint.blogspot.com/2005/10/debugging-domain-specific-languages.html" REL="nofollow">longer post on the topic</A>.)<br />

It is therefore crucial to be able to look behind the scenes.</I><BR/><BR/>It seems you're saying that you have to understand the drill to make the holes. I quite agree with that statement. So perhaps DSLs are not just implementation features for framework builders.<BR/><BR/>Of course, the bulk of my very short post is about convincing people to try drilling holes. During this "selling" phase, before the user has tried to make their own holes, I believe we need to emphasize the holes and not the drill bits.<BR/><BR/>As I noted with a wink, users will have plenty of time and motivation to come to grips with the details after they're hooked.<br />

Make people code Ruby when what they actually want is to code in their problem domain. Do you want to control compilation ? Use Rake (which is far better than make/ant). That's Ruby. Do you want to code a website ? Use Ruby on Rails (which is far better than all other web frameworks).<BR/><BR/>Ruby makes it possible to make good DSLs. It's hard to sell DSLability, but it's pretty easy to sell DSLs, and it will sell Ruby just as a side effect.<br />

But there is also the sale to would be DSL creators. They reinforce the drive of the platform. Ruby lowers the barrier of entry for creating DSLs in a good way, I think. (I am writing one in Java right now so I can tell.)<br />

								<a name="116007927347198652"></a> 				Matt: I think the main reason is that there is no single good standard implementation of Lisp.<BR/><BR/>Rake needed Ruby metaprogramming, but it also needed access to all standard Unix functions like globing, timestamp checks etc. Rails needed Ruby metaprogramming, but also SQL support, HTTP support, sockets etc.<BR/><BR/>Neither Common Lisp nor Scheme are very strong here. They tend to leave such "details" to implementations, and in the end you cannot write portable non-trivial Common Lisp/Scheme programs. Maybe if they all got behind a single implementation (some Scheme or some Common Lisp or Arc or Goo or even <A HREF="http://zabor.org/taw/rlisp/" REL="nofollow">RLisp</A>), and implemented a standard library that doesn't feel 1980ish, Lisp would be able to come back.<BR/><BR/>That, and the parenthesis ;-)<br />

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>From time to time I open my email and find someone asking a question:<br /><br /><blockquote>What the hell is Blub? I take from context that it may be a pejorative generalist term for programming languages that encourage writing pablum instead of programs. Or maybe it really is a new language out there that has a huge following I'm unaware of. </blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://chalain.livejournal.com/">Chalain</a>, the "<span style="font-style: italic;">if you're not having fun, you're doing</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> it wrong</span>" guy<br /></div><br /><a style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raganwald/15824364/" title="Preparing to climb Lollipop Kids"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/10/15824364_16defaae5e_m.jpg" alt="Preparing to climb Lollipop Kids" border="0" height="240" width="180" /></a>Actually, Blub is a hypothetical programming language Paul Graham invented when describing something very interesting: the <span style="font-style: italic;">Blub Paradox</span>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum... As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some feature he's used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages... Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.</blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Beating the Averages</a><br /></div><br />The interesting things about this paradox is that almost <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> language could be Blub. The pre-requisites for a language being Blub are (a) there is at least one language less powerful than Blub, (b) there is at least one language <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> powerful than Blub, and (c) that there be at least one programmer using Blub who accepts (a) but refutes (b) because he or she cannot see how the more powerful language is more powerful. She does not think in the <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/2006/01/finding-signal-to-noise-ratio-in-never.html">idioms</a> that the more powerful language affords.<br /><br /><div style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 240px; float: left; text-align: center; font-size: 85%;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLittle-MLer-Matthias-Felleisen%2Fdp%2F026256114X%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1165759722%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;amp;amp;tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&creative=9325"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://weblog.raganwald.com/uploaded_images/little_mler-705423.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="180" width="180" /></a><em><br /><br />The Little MLer introduces ML (and Ocaml) through a series of entertaining and straightforward exercises leading up to the construction of the Y Combinator.<br /><br />ML and OCaml introduce powerful strong typing and type inference. Both are great languages to learn: you will stretch your understanding of defining types and writing correct programs.<br /></em></div>When <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> use the term, I am thinking of the language and also the programmers around it. Could Java be Blub? Sometimes, possibly often, but only when I'm thinking about Java programmers who dismiss Ruby's features as unnecessary. <a href="http://t-a-w.blogspot.com/2006/08/programming-in-blub.html">Could Ruby be Blub</a>? Sometimes, but only when I'm thinking about Ruby programmers who dismiss macros as unimportant.<br /><br /><a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/12/lisp-is-not-last-word.html">Could Lisp be Blub?</a> I suspect that Erlang and Haskell programmers might say that it is, provided we can find a Lisp programmer who feels that all progress in programming languages stopped when Common Lisp was standardized.<br /><br />At the same time, Java is not Blub when I am thinking of programmers <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/10/in-praise-of-informed-choices.html">who are perfectly aware of its shortcomings and deliberately Greenspun around them for pragmatic reasons</a>. The same goes for any other language: it is sometimes Blub, and sometimes not Blub.<br /><br />So... I use the term "Blub" to refer to a programming language in the context of intransigent programmers who feel that their chosen tool is the best tool possible.<br /><br /><blockquote>Programming consists of overcoming two things: accidental difficulties, things which are difficult because you happen to be using inadequate programming tools, and things which are <em>actually difficult</em>, which no programming tool or language is going to solve. </blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/10/12.html">Joel Spolsky reviewing Beyond Java<br /></a></div><br />This provokes a very obvious question: <span style="font-style: italic;">How do we know which things are accidentally difficult and which are actually difficult</span>? Is it only because we haven't discovered the right tool yet?<br /><br />It's easy to find a Java programmer who believes that all of the Design Patterns in the GoF's book are necessary. She believes that the difficulties of applying those patterns are actual difficulties of programming systems. It is only when she learns a different language that she realizes how the patterns were strongly driven by limitations in Java's object model.<br /><br />At that point she has an epiphany and understands that what she thought were actual difficulties were merely accidental difficulties. And the line between "accidental" and "actual" moves for her.<br /><br />No matter how much each us us thinks we know right now, are we nevertheless like this Java programmer, unable to see the difference between accidental and actual differences because we simply haven't discovered a more powerful tool?<br /><br />Are we Blub programmers?<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">update</span>: <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/10/in-praise-of-informed-choices.html">In praise of informed choices</a> and </span><a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/12/lisp-is-not-last-word.html">Lisp is not the last word</a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/labels/java.html">java</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/labels/lispy.html">lispy</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/labels/popular.html">popular</a></p>&nbsp;

								<a name="116071309549589914"></a> 				I think there are neither Blub languages nor Blub programmers, but Blub language-programmer-project intersections.<BR/><BR/>I say this because, to me at least, Blub is synonymous with an improper choice of resources. I know this isn't the "canonical" definition of it, but I like mine better. Abstractions are great when they are needed, but using them when they are not is close to Rube Goldberg-oriented programming.<BR/><BR/>So, are we Blub programmers, under my definition? The scary answer is that most of the time we don't know. Highly specified languages aside (SQL, for example) it is difficult to tell if more abstractive ability, or speed, or better libraries, or _________ would be better for your project. <BR/><BR/>In the end would Java's libraries prove to be more of a benefit than Ruby's blocks? That almost sounds like comparing apples and bicycles, but it could be a very important question. It also seems like one that is almost impossible to answer in some cases.<br />

That a language is particularly suited for some kind of self-referential gimmicks does not qualify it a good application programming language and won't make it superiour than a pair of a language and a meta-programming system such as OCaml and Camlp4 that are closely related to each other.

But even those people usually don't dismiss any progress but simply find language customizations as usefull as adapting english grammar for having a conversation with different people on the street. So it is basically about designing programs and share knowledge across teams / a programmers community. Java people don't strive for "growing the language" but the library and argue for consistency of its design although I suspect they simply refer to their own established conventions and <I>language-games</I>. As we know these include also IDEs and XML that are external to the language but are considered as part of the languages <I>eco-system</I>. Maybe we shall reverse the perspective and call the Grahamian macho programmer as restricted and narrow-minded ( as has been done in general culture by the typical male chauvinist super-hero)?

There are some benefits to syntactic sugar.<BR/><BR/>For example, Python has a strict whitespace rule. This is diametrically opposed to Lisp's philosophy.<BR/><BR/>I'm not saying Python is better than Lisp, but clearly some people value the syntactic magic of significant whitespace.<BR/><BR/>A true Lisper says "it matters not, once a program is parsed it is an abstract syntax tree, and a Lisp AST looks like a Python AST." But a Python lover says that the readability of the program before parsing does matter.<BR/><BR/>I'm not saying that Python is better, or that the significant whitespace (which irritates many programmers) is a good idea.<BR/><BR/>But I am asking whether all idioms really can be reduced to ASTs and implemented using Lisp's Bottom Up Programming without losing their character?<BR/><BR/>Second, Lisp <A HREF="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/01/finding-signal-to-noise-ratio-in-never.html" REL="nofollow">has its own idioms for building or mimicking idioms</A>. Who is to say that there aren't better ways out there?<BR/><BR/>At best, we might say that Lisp is the best language discovered so far for building other languages. But I'm an optimist, and I believe that we may still improve on its language-building strength.<br />

								<a name="939748656147859716"></a> 				I think the problem with asking these questions is that whether language A is more powerful than language B is not clearly defined; in theory we can move from language A to language B by implementing a compiler for B in A, so languages A and B are equivalent in power (so long as they are "Turing complete").  But in practice something is wrong with this statement, so one could reasonably propose that there is no good existing model for the power of languages in the sense that you are trying to ask about.  Thus I think the only real answer to your question would be to develop a model so that we can meaningfully talk about the power of programming languages.<BR/><BR/>A simple model could use language subsets, and we could say A is a subset of B iff there exists a mapping from every program a in A to equivalent program b in B s.t. the mapping is a CFL when encoded as a language as a set of tuples (a, b).  But I think this model is flawed because I'm guessing that it will show that all conventional programming languages which are "Turing-complete" at compile time are subsets of each other and all other conventional programming languages are subsets of the "Turing-complete" ones.<BR/><BR/>So I'm guessing that a better model is needed, and I'm not sure exactly what the better model would be.  Is it possible to capture the practical aspects of whether a language A allows you to typically get away with writing an order or three orders of magnitude less code than language B?  I think this theoretical exercise may be solvable, and it's definitely worth trying (is there any literature on this?) as it would allow us to get a much better handle on what a "powerful language" is.<br />

								<a name="2930520824810000893"></a> 				Oops, I guess I can't edit posts.  Ignore that talk about mappings and CFLs as it is wrong (one can just implement a compiler in one language and call the compiler in the other language to show that any Turing-complete language is a "subset" of any other language, and once the compiler is written, the translation process between language A and B requires nothing more powerful than a DFA).  Don't know what I was thinking.  But it still seems like we should be able to define what we mean when we say "a language is powerful" or else point out some theoretical reason why we can't define this.<br />

								<a name="4418410644755844655"></a> 				I know I'm very late to this discussion, but one thing I think a number of people miss is that blub languages are optimal given the constraint of a person's or group's knowledge.<BR/><BR/>If I wish to do an achievable programming task X, then there's both a best possible language (given my knowledge of programming languages) that I know that can X (in other words, given what I know, I'll be able to pick out a language that fits what I know and satisfies my project objectives as best I can).<BR/><BR/>Then I can extend this list of programming languages to those I've heard of. That is, with some effort, I may be able to find a better language (as far as I can tell) for the task X. As I see it, the blub condition occurs when I see no language better than the one I already know.<BR/><BR/>As I see it, in the absence of costly experimentation, the blub language is optimal. I cannot come up with a better language unless I look around and try out some other languages. And there's no guarantee that I'll find something better for my purposes that will justify the effort I put into the search.<br />

								<a name="116111518756436607"></a> 				It should be the case again that shades of grey apply - if the problem is hard and it requires hard code to perform then so be it.  There may be more straight forward ways to solve the 'hard' problem but likely the hard code that was written to solve it will not look very different.  In this case I would just write a nice lengthy code comment to attempt to explain/justify what the hard code is doing.  I don't see the point in writing 'hard' code in a more simplistic drawn out way just because I can and because it would make it more understandable to a beginner - I would rather train and bring the begining programmer up to a level of understanding then dumb down something that maybe harder to understand but perfect elegant in execution.  - My 2 bits.<br />

The novice has to infer the "macro" behaviour from "micro" evidence, and in many cases this is a very hard job.<BR/><BR/>Remember, we are taking as a given that we are solving a "hard" problem, and if the problem is hard, inferring the "hard" solution from a pile of code is incredibly hard.<BR/><BR/>When we write at a higher level, whether by importing idioms or by using a more abstract tool, we might be able to express the entire "hard" solution in twenty lines of code.<BR/><BR/>It is far easier for the novice to grasp the "macro" solution from dramatically fewer lines of code.<BR/><BR/>There is still work to be done for the novice to figure out each line, but I find it easier to "drill down" than to "build up."<br />

								<a name="1788024490121682815"></a> 				Using the same reasoning, assembly languages are extremely simple (and they mostly are) - I can point to any handful of instructions and know exactly what they do. What I find difficult (and why people bother with higher level languages at all) is seeing the big picture. Each individual instruction is damned simple, but that does not make the overall routine or program simple. If anything, it makes it <B>harder</B> to understand because you have to keep more instructions in your head and think about how they fit together as a whole.<BR/><BR/>In a high level language, an <I>instruction</I> may be harder to understand, but it becomes a lot easier to understand the big picture. I think this is probably because you have to think about fewer <I>instructions</I> at once. My mind only has so much RAM...<BR/><BR/>For this reason, I completely agree with this post. When Hal Abelson and Gerry Sussman said that, they were (I would assume) talking about the big picture, not the individual instructions.<br />

To pick one nugget out of many, neurons are so slow that in the time it takes for us to react suddenly—say to duck a flying object—there is only time for a chain of at most 100 steps to complete. 100 steps do not permit us to perform <em>any</em> complex reasoning or look-up.

								<a name="116380717296795686"></a> 				If you like SICP, you might also like Concept, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming (CTM) by Peter Van Roy (PVR) and Seif Haridi.  I like how it uses the least concurrent and least stateful (most deterministic) solution that works for a given problem.  It also uses an interesting multiparadigm language called Oz, which pulls together all that is good from many popular languages.<BR/><BR/>Oh, and every programmer needs Code Complete Second Edition by Steve McConnell.  It's great for settling annoying code review comments that you sometimes get, like "aren't multiple returns evil?"<br />

								<a name="116499460481615294"></a> 				Without a doubt, "Annals of the Former World" by John McPhee. It's five books in one, spanning 20 years of work and explains geology, the history of geology as a science, the history of the earth, the lives of geologists, and so much more. It won a Pulitzer for nonfiction. McPhee has a great talent for writing about people, which is so essential to the readability of any book.<BR/><BR/>AotFW will leave you in complete awe of what a brief, tiny smudge the human race really is in the grand scheme of things.<br />

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>There has been a great deal of interest in <em><a href="http://gafter.blogspot.com/2007/01/definition-of-closures.html">closures</a></em> lately, driven in great part by the fact that there is talk of adding some form of anonymous functions to the Java. Most of the time, people talk about “adding closures” to Java, and that prompts a flurry of questions of the form “what is a closure and why should I care?”<br /><br />The discussion around closures tends to go on and on about the “closing over” of free variables and only lightly touch on the biggest change to Java: functions as first-class objects with a lightweight syntax for creating them. Making it easy to do something basic like define a new function is more than just a little syntactic sugar: it makes it easy to do new things with functions that were impractical when you needed a lot of boilerplate to make anything work.<br /><br /><blockquote>Without understanding functional programming, you can’t invent MapReduce, the algorithm that makes Google so massively scalable.<br /></blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">—Joel Spolsky, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">The Perils of JavaSchools</a><br /></div><br />I’m going to try to explain first class functions using Ruby (it <em>is</em> possible to write code that does exactly the same thing using the current Java feature set, however the result is so wordy that it obscures the basic idea being presented: call it accidental complexity, or perhaps <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2006/12/economizing-can-be-penny-wise-and.html">yellow code</a>.)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> is a good language for demonstrating features that ought to be in Java. Like Java, Ruby uses squiggly brace syntax. Like Java, everything in Ruby is an object&mdash;whoops, Java has primitives. Okay, like Java, functions are represented as objects.<br /><br />In Java you write:<br /><br /><pre><code>interface IFromIAndI {<br />   Integer call(Integer a, Integer b);<br />}<br /><br />IFromIAndI add_two_integers = new IFromIAndI() {<br />   public Integer call(final Integer a, final Integer b) {<br />      return a + b;<br />   }<br />};<br /></code></pre><br />(The Java convention is to name things in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">lowerCamelCase</a>, but we’ll ignore that. If you need to print this essay on a dot-matrix printer you may want to make some changes first.)<br /><br />In Ruby you write the function as:<br /><br /><pre><code>add_two_integers = lambda { |a,b| a + b }<br /></code></pre><br />Later on, when you want to call your function in Java, you write:<br /><br /><pre><code>add_two_integers.call(35, 42);<br /></code></pre><br />And if you like semicolons, you write the <em>exact same thing</em> in Ruby:<br /><br /><pre><code>add_two_integers.call(35, 42);<br /></code></pre><br />You can do the same thing with multiplication:<br /><br /><pre><code>multiply_two_integers = lambda { |a,b| a * b }<br /></code></pre><br /><strong>First Class Functions</strong><br /><br />In the examples above, functions look a little like methods. The Java version is obviously implemented as a method. But what we did in both cases was assign the resulting function to a variable. In Java, assigning a method to a variable is not particularly easy (it is possible using reflection).<br /><br />Anything that can be assigned to a variable is a <em>value</em>. If it can also be passed as a parameter or returned from a method (or function), we say it is a <em>first class value</em>. Functions as first class values, or first class functions, are very interesting. For example, what can we do passing a function as a parameter to another function?<br /><br />Hmmm. Well, I am breaking a cardinal rule of selling something. We’re talking about shiny new toys without identifying a problem to be solved. Let’s talk about my favourite problem: writing the same thing more than once, violating the <acronym title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym> principle.<br /><br />Here are two pieces of similar Ruby code:<br /><br /><pre><code>adder_wth_acc = lambda { |acc, list|<br />   if list.empty?<br />      acc<br />   else<br />      adder_wth_acc.call(acc + list.first, list[1..-1]) # [1..-1] returns a copy of the list without the first element<br />   end<br />}<br />adder = lambda { |list|<br />   adder_wth_acc.call(0, list)<br />}<br />adder.call([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br /></code></pre><br />And:<br /><br /><pre><code>multiplier_with_acc = lambda { |acc, list|<br />   if list.empty?<br />      acc<br />   else<br />      multiplier_with_acc.call(acc * list.first, list[1..-1]) # [1..-1] returns a copy of the list without the first element<br />   end<br />   }<br />   multiplier = lambda { |list|<br />   multiplier_with_acc.call(1, list)<br />}<br />multiplier.call([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br /></code></pre><br />What do they both do? Pretty much the same thing: they accumulate the result of some binary operation over a list of values. <code>adder</code> accumulates addition, and <code>multiplier</code> accumulates multiplication. You could call this a “Design Pattern.” If you did that, you would use the exact chunk of code everywhere. I would call that retrograde. Didn’t our predecessors invent the subroutine so we could eliminate writing the exact same piece of code over and over again?<br /><br />Why can’t we do the same thing? Well, we can. A subroutine does the same thing over and over again, but it takes different parameters as it goes. What is different between adder and multiplier? Ah yes, the adding and multiplying. Functions. What we want is a function that takes a function as a parameter.<br /><br />Well, we said that with first-class functions, functions are values and can be passed as parameters. Let’s try it:<br /><br /><pre><code>folder = lambda { |default_value, binary_function, list|<br />   fold_with_acc = lambda { |acc, list|<br />      if list.empty?<br />          acc<br />      else<br />          fold_with_acc.call(binary_function.call(acc, list.first), list[1..-1])<br />      end<br />   }<br />   fold_with_acc.call(default_value, list)<br />}<br /></code></pre><br />Now we can use our function that takes functions as a parameter:<br /><br /><pre><code>folder.call(0, add_two_integers, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br />folder.call(1, multiply_two_integers, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br /></code></pre><br />This is <strong>much</strong> better. When functions can take functions as parameters, we can build abstractions like <code>folder</code> and save ourselves a lot of code. Note that this would be a lot harder to read if we had to surround all of our functions with Object boilerplate in Java. That’s one of the key reasons why ‘syntactic sugar’—making it brief—is a big win.<br /><br />And you know what? Functions are values, not just variables that happen to hold functions. These work just as well:<br /><br /><pre><code>folder.call(0, lambda { |a, b| a + b }, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br />folder.call(1, lambda { |a, b| a * b }, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br /></code></pre><br />There’s just one problem (actually two, but I’m saving one for later): everywhere you use our new <code>folder</code> function, you need to remember that <code>add_two_integers</code> needs a default value of zero, but <code>multiply_two_integers</code> needs a default value of one. That’s bad. Sooner or later you will get this wrong.<br /><br />What we need is a way to call <code>folder</code> without having to always remember the correct initial value. Should we extend our understanding of a function to include a default initial value for folding? If we’re thinking in Java, maybe our <code>IFromIAndI</code> interface needs a <code>getDefaultFoldValue</code>? I think not. Why should a function know anything about how it’s used? And besides, as we build other abstractions out of functions we’ll need more stuff.<br /><br />If we aren’t careful, we’ll end up implementing the <code>Visitor</code> pattern on functions, and all of our brevity will go out the window. No, what we want is this: in one place we define that folding addition starts with a default value of zero and in another place we say we want to fold, say, <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> with addition. Then when we want to fold something else with addition, like <code>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code>, we shouldn’t have to say anything about zero again.<br /><br /><strong>Adding Curry</strong><br /><br />What we need is a function that folds addition. Didn’t we say that functions are values that can be returned from functions? How about a function that makes a folding function? We should pass it our initial value and our binary function, and it should return a function that performs the fold without needing an initial value as a parameter:<br /><br /><pre><code>fold_coder = lambda { |default_value, binary_function|<br />   fold_with_acc = lambda { |acc, list|<br />      if list.empty?<br />          acc<br />      else<br />          fold_with_acc.call(binary_function.call(acc, list.first), list[1..-1])<br />      end<br />   }<br />   lambda { |list|<br />      fold_with_acc.call(default_value, list)<br />   }<br />}<br /></code></pre><br />Now we can do the following:<br /><br /><pre><code>adder = fold_coder.call(0, lambda { |a, b| a + b })<br />adder.call([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br />adder.call([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])<br /></code></pre><br />No more remembering that addition starts with a default of zero.<br /><br /><blockquote>Actually, there’s a far simpler way to avoid having to remember the default value when you want to fold over addition. But let’s just play along so that we don’t have to come up with an entirely new set of examples to demonstrate the value of functions as first-class values.<br /></blockquote>Functional programmers (as opposed to the rest of us <em>dysfunctional</em> programmers) will recognize this as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a> our <code>folder</code> function. Currying is when a function takes more than one parameter and you combine one of the parameters and the function to produce a function that takes fewer parameters.<br /><br />Here’s a currying function in Ruby:<br /><br /><pre><code>curry = lambda { |fn,*a|<br />   lambda { |*b|<br />     fn.call(*(a + b))<br />   }<br />}<br /></code></pre><br />(<em>This is an improvement on an earlier version, thanks to Justin's <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/01/closures-and-higher-order-functions.html#117037273013059827">comment</a>.</em>)<br /><br />So you can use our new function to create an increment function out of our adder and a treble function out of our multiplier:<br /><br /><pre><code>plus_one = curry.call(add_two_integers, 1)<br />times_three = curry.call(multiply_two_integers, 3)<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If you are ever asked, “what good is currying?,” I hope I’ve given you an example you can use to explain why currying matters, and why people do it all the time (possibly without explicitly naming it). Although it doesn’t look like much when looking at trivial examples like functions that multiply by three, it’s much more useful when creating folders and mappers where you want some of the parameters to remain constant.<br /><br /><strong>Composition</strong><br /><br />Our examples combined functions and non-functions to create new functions. Here’s an example from a recent post, <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/01/dont-overthink-fizzbuzz.html">Don’t Overthink FizzBuzz</a>, where I give a method for <em>composing</em> two functions. The idea is that if you have multiple functions that each take one argument, you can combine them using <code>compose</code>. I also have a method that generates functions, <code>carbnation</code>:<br /><br /><pre><code># fizzbuzz.rb<br /><br />def compose *lambdas<br />  if lambdas.empty?<br />    lambda { nil }<br />  elsif lambdas.size == 1<br />    lambdas.first<br />  else<br />    lambda do |n|<br />      lambdas.first.call(compose(*lambdas[1..-1]).call(n))<br />    end<br />  end<br />end<br /><br />def carbonation(modulus, printable_form)<br />  i = 0<br />  lambda do |n|<br />    (i = (i + 1) % modulus) == 0 && printable_form || n<br />  end<br />end<br /><br />print(((1..100).map   &compose(     carbonation(15, 'FizzBuzz'), carbonation(5, 'Buzz'), carbonation(3, 'Fizz'))).join(' '))<br /><br /></code></pre><br />The simple explanation of how it works is that <code>carbonation</code> generates functions that replace every so many elements of a list with a printable string. <code>Compose</code> composes any two or more methods together. So if you want to print out 100 numbers, but replace every third number with “Fizz,” every fifth with “Buzz,” and all those that are third <strong>and</strong> fifth with “FizzBuzz,” you generate a function for each replacement, compose them together with compose, and then map the numbers from one to one hundred to the resulting überfunction.<br /><br />When you look at this today, it seems weird and unreadable by Java standards. I wonder if adding first-class functions with simple syntax to Java will lead the Java community to a place where code like this will not appear out of place?<br /><br /><strong>Just one more thing</strong><br /><br />So we started by saying that people are getting hung up on what makes a closure a closure, and there has been less emphasis on the benefits of using functions as first-class values. Did you notice that our <code>folder</code> function actually includes a non-trivial closure?<br /><br />If you look at the <code>fold_with_acc</code> function, it makes use of <code>binary_function</code>, a variable from its enclosing lexical scope. This is not possible with the current version of Java: if you translate this to Java, when you make <code>fold_with_acc</code> and anonymous inner class, you will have to copy <code>binary_function</code> into a final member to use it. It simply won’t compile if you try an idiom-for-idiom translation, even adding explicit types.<br /><br />And then if you look at the anonymous function it returns, <code>lambda { |list| fold_with_acc.call(default_value, list) }</code>, that anonymous function uses <code>default_value</code>,another variable from the enclosing lexical scope. Once again you will have to fool around with final variables to make this work, or perhaps declare full-fledged object with constructors.<br /><br />(If you try writing this simple example out in Java, you quickly find yourself inventing a lot of classes or interfaces. And they have some complicated types, like a function taking an integer and a function taking two integers, returning a function taking a list of integers and returning an integer.<br /><br />After twenty minutes of that, you understand why the <a href="http://www.ml.com/">ML</a> and <a href="http://planet.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> communities use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">type inference</a>: If the types are that complicated, it&rsquo;s incredibly helpful to have the compiler check them for you. Yet if the types are that verbose, it&rsquo;s incredibly painful to write them out by hand. Even if your IDE were to write them for you, they take up half the code, obscuring the meaning.<br /><br />You also get why the Ruby on Rails community doesn&rsquo;t care about type checking: types for CRUD applications are way less complicated than types for first-class functional programs.)<br /><br /><strong>That’s Interesting</strong><br /><br />Part of the interest in closures is in simplifying the syntax around functions, and part of the interest is in the way that access to enclosing scope would simplify a lot of code. There’s a whole debate around the value of simplification in a world where all serious languages are <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/01/turing_equivalent_vs_turing_co.php#more">Turing Equivalent</a>.<br /><blockquote><br />I hope you’re convinced, by now, that programming languages with first-class functions let you find more opportunities for abstraction, which means your code is smaller, tighter, more reusable, and more scalable.<br /></blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">—Joel Spolsky, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">Can Your Programming Language Do This?</a><br /></div><br />For me, simpler is just nicer until something reaches a certain tipping point: when it becomes so simple that the accidental complexity of using it goes away, I will start using it without thinking about it. Tail optimization is like that: as long as recursion is slower than iteration and sometimes breaks, I have to think about it too much. But when I’m not burdened with “except…” and “when performance is not a factor…” it becomes natural.<br /><br />And then something interesting happens. It changes the way I look at problems, and one day I see a whole new way to do something that I never saw before. Functions as first class values are definitely one of those things that change everything.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Further Reading<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br /></span></span>If this has whet your appetite for more, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262011530?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&creativeASIN=0262011530">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> is <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> book on higher-order functions and how they can be used as building blocks to create more elaborate abstractions such as object-oriented programming.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026256100X?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=026256100X">The Seasoned Schemer</a> devotes an entire book to the uses of functions.

I like most of them, but could you do me a favour and not spread lies such as MapReduce being a functional construct?  It's a flow based construct.  The functional version is extremely limited and actually flies in the face of functional programming most of the time by requiring the use of I/O, thus breaking the functional paradigm.<BR/><BR/>MapReduce is an argument against functional programming, not for it.

This musician does not take requests. But the nice thing is this: you can write your own blog, and you can add comments to my blog.<BR/><BR/>I like it best, quite frankly, when people do both: they write a post on their own blog with their own perspective and drop a comment on my blog with a link so that readers can see what they have to say. Everybody wins!<BR/><BR/>Now about MapReduce: I didn't say anything, so perhaps you want to talk to <A HREF="http://joelonsoftware.com" REL="nofollow">Joel</A>.  I quoted him saying <I>Without understanding functional programming, you can’t invent MapReduce</I>.<BR/><BR/>That is probably true. Let's start with  the fact that MapReduce is based on the mapping and folding operations. They came from functional programming.<BR/><BR/>It's true that the parallelization comes from data flow programming, but Joel's statement is that understanding map and reduce (which is transitive folding) is a necessary precondition to inventing MapReduce.<BR/><BR/>Here's what Google itself <A HREF="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html" REL="nofollow">has to say</A>:<BR/><BR/><I>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.</I><BR/><BR/>Note: there are two pieces, a <I>programming model</I> and an <I>implementation</I>. I think the programming model is functional: the phrases "map function" and "reduce function" are highly suggestive, don't you agree?<br />

								<a name="117035600630472875"></a> 				The folding operation is hard. But for any given (simple, non-composite) fold, you can write a for loop.<BR/><BR/>It is true that it is a qualitative difference to be able to write a fold, and composite functions together, etc. But you have to get past that first step to get to the point where you understand it. By the time you've written an example that is really advantageous over a simple for loop, the example is too complicated to be followed.<BR/><BR/>I'm not sure "I can do that with a for loop" really qualifies as "trolling"; in some sense, it's a perfectly valid objection. I think it's acceptable to ask that a "new" feature actually do something useful and not merely be a respelling of an existing feature, and it's incumbent upon the person pushing the "new" feature to explain why it really is better than this other straightforward thing over there.<BR/><BR/>(Part of the source of this particular example was exactly a real-world solution. We were outputting something in PDF and HTML, and despite the radically different paradigms for creating a PDF (command-based with our library) and HTML (string-concatenation, ultimately), the closures solved a problem nicely that no amount of for-loops or OO design could have. I ended up cutting a discussion of this since it seemed redundant.)<br />

What do I care what other people think? Or how they go about their programming careers? Why should I "push" someone out of their comfort zone?<BR/><BR/>My weblog is a recitation of things that interest me and that I have found useful.<BR/><BR/>Functional programming is not new. Here is this thing that is something like fifty years old, is accepted by virtually everyone who takes the trouble to learn how it works as being extremely useful, yet the programming community in the large has trouble accepting its value. <BR/><BR/>Sure, there is one argument that maybe it isn't really useful.<BR/><BR/>There's another argument that programming has some cultural issues where the most useful things are not always the most popular.<BR/><BR/>I have accepted the latter explanation. So what is the point of trying to prove it is useful?<BR/><BR/>I have no evidence that programmers in general have any inclination to even <I>try</I> new ideas or tools (although they will spend all day explaining why what they are doing is <A HREF="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/01/false-dichotomy-of-choosing-between.html" REL="nofollow">expedient</A>).<BR/><BR/>In the end, it will come down to the "open vs. closed mind" bifurcation.<BR/><BR/>Someone with an open mind looks at something and immediately wonders "how can I use this to my advantage?"<BR/><BR/>Someone with a closed mind looks at something and wonders "what are all of the ways this thing is inferior to what I already know?"<BR/><BR/>I'm all for finding better ways to share ideas with the former group, but I'm not so confident in my understanding of programming or my writing skill to think I can have any impact whatsoever on the latter type of person.<BR/><BR/>The purpose of my post was to explain what closures and first-class functions are. In my mind I was imagining a reader who has only the most cursory exposure and wonders what all the fuss is about.<BR/><BR/>My hope is that such a person might read this and say "Ok, I get what this is, I get what Java programs might look like if this is added to the language."<BR/><BR/>If I'm really lucky, perhaps such a reader might one day be looking at a problem and think "Hey, this looks familiar, maybe I can write a method for this class that returns a function..."<BR/><BR/>I would personally consider this essay a win if just one such person emails me one day to say "thanks, here's how I used what I read."<br />

								<a name="117036257705908471"></a> 				It's hard to sell closures and first-class functions to programmers who haven't already used them. (Heaven knows, <A HREF="http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2005/08/30/closures-and-the-professional-programmer" REL="nofollow">I've tried</A>.) It's not that these programmers are too close-minded to "get" closures (although some are), but rather that the human imagination is too limited to render the (very pleasant) realities of programming with a "new" tool as powerful as closures without filling in the gaps with what it already knows.  As a result, closures and first-class functions end up being imagined as syntax-sweetened anonymous inner classes and thus lose many of their real benefits. Why do I need another syntax for anonymous inner classes? the OO programmer wonders – and then moves on.<BR/><BR/>The best way to demonstrate the benefits of closures and first-class functions is to have programmers use them for a few months.  Then try to take these new tools away.  When the programmers reach for your throat, you can be confident that they "got" the benefits.  As they go for the strangle-hold, you can shout, "See! I <EM>told</EM> you you would like them!"  ;-)<BR/><BR/>Admittedly, such a demonstration doesn't fit into the blog format very well.<br />

								<a name="117037273013059827"></a> 				I completely agree that "simpler is just nicer until something reaches a certain tipping point".  I don't often make use of new programming techniques as soon as I learn them because I'm already accustomed solving problems using different idioms.  However, once I stumble on something that works really nicely with my fancy new construct, I start to see uses for it everywhere.<BR/><BR/>I noticed that you mention your curry function only works on binary functions due to a limitation in the way Ruby parses arguments passed to lambdas.  Have you considered using the 'splat' operator?  Including a splat before the final parameter to a function will cause it to soak up any number of remaining arguments into an array (which will be empty if there are none).  Unless I misunderstand your point, you could use splat to create a curry function that takes functions of arbitrary arity:<BR/>(I apologize in advance for the contrived example)<BR/><BR/>curry = lambda { |fn,a|    # where fn takes any number of arguments<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp lambda { |*b|<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fn.call(a,*b)<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp }<BR/>}<BR/><BR/>so if you have:<BR/>add_three_things = lambda { |a,b,c| a + b + c }<BR/><BR/>you can do:<BR/>add_10_to_two_things = curry.call(add_three_things, 10)<BR/>add_10_to_two_things.call(1,2)             # => 13<BR/><BR/>Moreover, you could define curry to take an arbitrary number of arguments to pass as parameters to the function you are currying:<BR/><BR/>curry = lambda { |fn,*a|<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp lambda { |*b|<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fn.call(*(a + b))<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp }<BR/>}<BR/><BR/>so now this also works:<BR/>add_10_then_add_1_to_something = curry.call(add_three_things, 10, 1)<BR/>add_10_then_add_1_to_something.call(5)      # => 16<BR/><BR/>While you're at it, you could also define an operator which supports right-currying (all of the previous examples are left-currying because the curried arguments are passed to the function first).<BR/><BR/>rcurry = lambda { |fn,*a|<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp lambda { |*b|<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fn.call(*(b + a))<BR/>&nbsp&nbsp }<BR/>}<BR/><BR/>so you could do things like:<BR/>add_then_multiply = lambda { |a, b, c| (a + b) * c }<BR/>add_then_multiply_by_10 = rcurry.call(add_then_multiply, 10)<BR/>add_then_multiply_by_10.call(1,2)           # => 30<BR/><BR/><BR/>Great post!<BR/><BR/>p.s. Thanks also to Tom Moertel who's blog was my first encounter with first-class functions in Ruby.<br />

I never thought I'd see the day where someone was a troll on his own blog.  I was just asking not to spread lies.  If lies are your thing, then I'll know what to expect from now on.<BR/><BR/>BTW, writing a blog entry is utterly pointless unless you're fishing for links.  The response belongs here.  I never said you were the source of the lie.  I said you're spreading it.  I also never said anything about parallelism although that's a good point too.  It's about functionality.  The concept of MapReduce comes from flow based programming, not functional.  You don't need functional programming to understand it either.<br />

That's a complete non-starter.<BR/><BR/>You don't see me telling Rusty not to write about why Java should be hobbled because the guy down the hall can't be trusted.<BR/><BR/>You don't see me telling Reinier not to write that IDE support is more important than language flexibility.<BR/> <BR/>You have a strong opinion about something I quoted. Well, here are some options (pick all that apply):<BR/><BR/>1. You can continue to complain that I don't agree with you here in the comments;<BR/><BR/>2. You can go to the source, Joel Spolsky, and tell him to change what he wrote on <I>his</I> blog;<BR/><BR/>3. You can write your own refutation on your own blog.<BR/><BR/>This is what works for me.

Only that much here: Going back 20 years to SICP is not moving Java forward. Today, closures are great not because you can iterate over lists and add integers, but because they allow better domain-specific modelling (where a DSL might be an example of "can use without thinking", as you say).<BR/>And maybe maybe closures allow you to whip up a write-only application faster - this may be relevant for RoR-style webapps.<br />

I guess it is on purpose but it does not serve well the readability cause.</I><BR/><BR/>So.. it comes down to having a sense of whimsey. Guilty as charged. A colleague just showed me some production code with a method called "hydrate" that turned a Java interface into an anonymous object.<BR/><BR/>I had to read the code to figure out what it did, the name didn't immediately suggest its purpose.<BR/><BR/>But you know... anything involving reflection and proxying almost always must be read to be understood, so a name like "doInstantiateAnonymousPOJOFromInterface" would not have been that helpful.<BR/><BR/><I>it is not very clear what 'n' and 'i' represent (ubiquity ?)</I><BR/><BR/>This is simultaneously a well-understood idiom and an anti-pattern. Some people hate Fortran-like names, others do not.<BR/><BR/>Do you think it would me more readable if we chose names like "numberForKeepingTrackOfOurPositionInTheList" and "nameOfTheItemInTheList"?<BR/><BR/>If so, grep is your friend. The code will do the same thing either way.<BR/><BR/><I>the function seems to be coupled to compose. I mean without 'compose' I do not believe you would have written carbonation that way.</I><BR/><BR/>The function is actually coupled to the premise that you might want to carbonate lists that are not consecutive integers.<BR/><BR/>For example, roman numerals, or words written out like "three", "four."<BR/><BR/>Is this a good idea? Of course not. The title of the post is, after all, "Don't Overthink Fizzbuzz." I was deliberately trying to think of a plausible but inadvisable example of overgeneralizing a program.<BR/><BR/>In this case, we have made it more complex than necessary to accommodate variations involving lists that are not integers and other modulii such as seven or eleven.<BR/><BR/><I>it should not be too hard to guess why some might dislike:<BR/>(i = (i + 1) % modulus) == 0 && printable_form || n</I><BR/><BR/>I've heard that people dislike the language J as well. What can I do about people's taste?<BR/><BR/>FWIW, the above is a well-known Ruby idiom. Writing it otherwise tends towards writing a Java program using Ruby syntax.<BR/><BR/>If we wrote it out on five or six lines, it would say the same thing with more white space.<BR/><BR/>That is visually pleasing at first glance, but repeated throughout a huge program, you end up with reams of code to wade through to find anything.<BR/><BR/>The complexity content doesn't change by splitting it up. You still say:<BR/><BR/>add one to i. take the modulus of the result. if that is zero give the printable form, otherwise give the 'number' passed in.<BR/><BR/><I>I hate 'paternalist' language but IMHO this is pushing free style at little bit too far.</I><BR/><BR/>Well know, this is what makes the world such an interesting place. One programmer's free style is another programmer's standard idiom.<BR/><BR/>I know a tribe of C programmers who do something like #define EVER ;;<BR/><BR/>Thereafter, when they want an unbounded loop, they write for(EVER) { ... }.<BR/><BR/>Since they all work together, they recognize it at once. But they had to explain it to me.<br />

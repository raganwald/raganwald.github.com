					<div style="clear:both;"></div><strong>C</strong><br /><br />A fellow needs a dog house, so he hires a contractor. This guy is a C programmer who&#8217;s between jobs at the moment, and he says forget those wimpy &#8220;agile&#8221; wooden dog houses, he can build the dog house out of bricks, it will last forever and is stronger than any wood structure.<br /><br />The client is doubtful, but that sounds very impressive, and the contractor says this is how all the real-world dog houses are made, so he agrees. Well, it takes forever: it seems every time the contractor thinks it&#8217;s finished, they discover there&#8217;s a chink between the bricks and there&#8217;s a leak. With wood you just trim to fit, but with bricks you have to plan everything in advance so that the bricks line up just right.<br /><br />But Spring turns to Summer turns to Autumn, and the job is done. The client pays up, and the contractor&#8217;s about to leave when he stops and thinks for a moment before speaking.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey,&#8221; the contractor says, &#8220;You paid for a pallet of bricks, and I used all but one. It&#8217;s a shame if it goes to waste. Why don&#8217;t I see if I can use it somewhere?&#8221; The client asks like what, and before you know it the contractor has scored a contract to build a brick path for the dog from the back door to the dog house. He orders some more bricks, gets to work right away, and this time things go a little better.<br /><br />The contractor is now doing C++ on the side. And he uses some new bricklaying techniques he learned from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321334876?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321334876">Effective C++</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321334876" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />: there are these funny angle braces everywhere thanks to his path building templates. Soon that job is done and the contractor collects his fee. He&#8217;s about to leave, but he reaches into his tool chest and pulls out a brick.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey,&#8221; the contractor says, &#8220;You paid for another pallet of bricks, and I used all but one on the path. It&#8217;s a shame if it goes to waste. Why don&#8217;t I see if I can use it somewhere?&#8221; The client is happy with the path, asks like what, and before you know it the contractor has scored another contract, this time to build a brick wall enclosing the yard. He orders some more bricks, and gets to work right away.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the contractor has become a Visual C++ programmer and reads MSDN magazine religiously. He applies his new skills to building the wall: he has all these fancy tools that can put up sections of scaffolding when you push a button. of course, there are huge holes you have to fill in yourself, and the scaffolding has all these crazy joins and angles, it&#8217;s hard to change anything or understand how the entire wall fits together, but it feels like you&#8217;re getting a lot done because the system seems to move a lot of bricks for you.<br /><br />Well, the wall takes forever, and it doesn&#8217;t look that good when it&#8217;s finally done. But the client pays up and the contractor is ready to leave. But he stops for a moment and pulls a brick out of his tool chest.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey,&#8221; the contractor says, &#8220;You paid for two more pallets of bricks for the wall, and I used all but one. It&#8217;s a shame if it goes to waste. Why don&#8217;t I see if I can use it somewhere?&#8221;<br /><br />The client has had enough of this, and he decides he&#8217;s going to show the contractor how he feels. &#8220;Give me that brick,&#8221; he orders. The surprised contractor hands it over. &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass about this brick&#8221; the client huffs, and he throws the brick clear out of his yard.<br /><br />&#8220;I need to get work done, not talk to contractors all day about bricks. And besides, I&#8217;ve talked to the big landscape contracting companies, and they all say nobody is using bricks, everyone has switched to sharp tools and netting. Now get out.&#8221;<br /><br /><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong><br /><br />Just inside the gates of heaven, St. Peter sits at a desk checking people in.<br /><br />Peter:  &#8220;Welcome to heaven.

Before searing it and placing it in the pan, she carefully sliced the ends off. Her three year-old daughter asked &#8220;Mommy, why do you cut the ends off the roast?&#8221;<br /><br />She answered, &#8220;My mom taught me to do it that way, and it&#8217;s delicious, so it must be a good idea. Maybe the juices from the meat mix with the vegetables?&#8221;<br /><br />Everyone sits down for dinner, and when Father is serving the roast, the daughter remembers her question. She turns to Grandma and asks, &#8220;Grandma, why did you teach Mommy to cut the ends off the roast?&#8221;<br /><br />Grandma thinks for a moment and says, &#8220;What a delightful question! I always used to cut the ends off the roast, it&#8217;s how <em>my</em> mother taught me. I don&#8217;t know why she did that, there must have been a good reason.&#8221; Grandma sits for a moment, remembering her mother. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she continues, &#8221; there must have been a good reason. Now eat your dinner before it gets cold!&#8221;<br /><br />The holidays roll around, and they&#8217;re having dinner at Grandma and Grandpa&#8217;s house. &#8220;Hey!&#8221; Grandma says to the little girl, &#8220;You know what, I was going through your great-grandmother&#8217;s things, and I found the old roast pan. We sure made some good pot roast in it. Let&#8217;s make pot roast with it tonight in her honour!&#8221;<br /><br />They get out the pan and wash it up. It&#8217;s old, and well-seasoned. Grandma looks it over. &#8220;It&#8217;s smaller than I remember. I was a little girl, and everything looks bigger when you&#8217;re small!&#8221;<br /><br />They put the roast on the counter before searing it. Just then, Grandpa walks by. &#8220;Do you want me to cut the ends off the roast?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;ll get it to fit in that small pan.&#8221;<br /><br />Grandma and the little girl look at each other. And they smile.<br /><br /><strong>Scheme</strong><br /><br />A fellow is on vacation, and he decides to ride one of those &#8220;scenic&#8221; double-decker buses that drive around from attraction to attraction. The upper level is open-air, and he&#8217;s the only one up there. He looks around, and decides that instead of re-reading his copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262560992?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262560992">The Little Schemer</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262560992" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, he&rsquo;s going to really enjoy himself: he lights a cigar.<br /><br />No sooner has he lit the cigar when a woman comes huffing and puffing upstairs, carrying one of those sub-miniature dogs people use as fashion accessories. She takes one look at our man and demands he put the cigar out: it is <em>offensive to the dog</em>.<br /><br />&#8220;Madam,&#8221; our man asserts, &#8220;this cigar is not offensive. Let me tell you its secrets.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Eschewing inferior mass-market tobacco, I order whole, functional leaves&#8212;at great expense and with difficulty&#8212;from a small collective in Cuba that still grow cigar tobacco the old-fashioned, original way.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Unsullied by automatic rolling machines or other push button devices, I roll each cigar, myself, by hand. Using secret tobacco-macro techniques that are impenetrable to the typical ignorant cigarette smoker, I am able to pack as much smoking pleasure into a single cigar as would take a carton of cigarettes&#8212;nay, it is impossible to enjoy a smoke from regular cigarettes as much as I enjoy the elite, exclusive flavour of my cigars.&#8221;<br /><br />The woman is not impressed. &#8220;If your cigars are so good, how come nobody smokes them?&#8221; she asks. &#8220;If your cigars are so good, how come so many clubs and restaurants permit cigarettes but forbid cigars?&#8221;<br /><br />Our fellow is so irate he begins to splutter. &#8220;If you or your dog are unable to understand that the purity, the perfection achieved long ago on a remote island far from consumerism and mass productio&#8212;&#8221; But he is unable to finish, for the woman imperiously sweeps the cigar from his mouth and flings it over the side of the bus.<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think of your pompous cigar.&#8221; She tells him.<br /><br />He glares at her for a moment, then years of oppression, of being forced to live with the hated cigarettes against his will, bring him to a boil and he commits an unthinkable act. With a wrench, he seizes the dog and flings it after his cigar. There is a moment of uncomprehending shock, and then the woman begins to howl.<br /><br />Well, the bus driver hears all this and slams on the brakes. For a moment everything is higgledy-piggledy, and just as the woman&#8217;s wails return to their full volume, everyone is shocked to see the dog come trotting up, unharmed.<br /><br />And what do you know: the dog has&mdash;nestled gently in its mouth&mdash;the most unexpected thing:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rot13.com/index.php?text=Gur%20Oevpx" title="The Brick">Gur Oevpx</a>.<br /><hr><br />If you enjoyed these stories, you may also like <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2005/07/why-you-need-degree-to-work-for-bigco.html">Why You Need a Degree to Work For BigCo</a> and more recently, <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/04/venture-capitalist-passes-away.html">A Venture Capitalist passes away peacefully, and...</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/java.html">java</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/lispy.html">lispy</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://raganwald.github.com/labels/ruby.html">ruby</a></p>&nbsp;

								<a name="4554679422174278360"></a> 				I came across this the other day (can't remember where):<BR/><BR/>A project manager, hardware engineer and software engineer were in a car heading down a hill when the brakes failed. The driver managed to get it stopped by using the gears and a convenient dirt track.<BR/><BR/>All three jumped out and after peering under the car the hardware engineer said, "I see what the problem is and with this handy roll of duct tape I think I can fix it good enough to get us to the next town". The project manager quickly interrupted, "No, no, no. Before we do anything we need to decide on a vision for our future, figure out a plan and assign individual deliverables". At which point the software engineer said, "You know what, I think we should push the car back up to the top of the hill and see if it happens again".<BR/><BR/><BR/>Thanks for the linkage the other day by the way :)<br />

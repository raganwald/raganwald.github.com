					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Obie wrote <a href="http://www.jroller.com/obie/entry/top_10_reasons_why_java" title="Top 10 Reasons Why Java Sucks Ass">a wildly satirical post</a> wherein he set his phasers to &#8220;Disintegrate, with maximum prejudice.&#8221; Of course, there has been a backlash. Including from <a href="http://sablog.com/archives/2007/09/27/entire-activerecordruby-thread-0wned-by-a-single-comment" title="Entire ActiveRecord/Ruby Thread 0wned by a Single Comment">people who love Ruby</a>.<br /><br />Well, first, let me talk to people using Rails and Ruby who are miffed that Obie has made people angry. Should be be censured? I say <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075222/quotes" title="Silent Movie (1976) - Memorable quotes">Non</a>.<br /><br />You are nice people. You don&#8217;t want to offend anyone. You want to reach out and hold hands and embrace and take over the world with non-violent peace and love. I&#8217;m all for that, and I applaud you. The world is a better place with you in it. Obie isn&#8217;t that way, not always, that much is obvious. If this were the sixties, I have a feeling he would be throwing rocks at the pigs. And you would abhor his actions as counterproductive. You would complain he&#8217;s alienating the people you want to convert.<br /><br />That&#8217;s how movements work: <em>There is no single cohesive, Ruby community with a single purpose and a single, co&ouml;rdinated plan of action</em>. There are a bunch of people, some of whom form little groups, some form big groups, some go one way, some go another.<br /><br />This is really why Ruby will not take over the world in its present form, of course. The other side has huge corporations, where everybody is in it for the career, for the money. They&#8217;re passionate about their career, about making money. So if you say &#8220;Hey, be nice to so-and-so so you can get a bonus cheque,&#8221; they are nice to so-and-so. What do they care about whether they actually like that person or not?<br /><br />But people who are in it for the passion, they are opinionated. And the beauty is, we (I count myself as passionate) all have our own individual ideas. Which means we bring a lot more to the table than a million monkeys marching in lock step. They can overwhelm anything in their path, but they only have one path, they only go one way. We let a thousand flower bloom. And sometimes, we work against each other.<br /><br />For example, why are the three major Ruby VM efforts (<a href="http://blog.fallingsnow.net/rubinius/">Rubinus</a>, <a href="http://www.atdot.net/yarv/" title="YARV: Yet Another Ruby VM">YARV</a>, and <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>)? Is this the work of people who can agree on anything?<br /><br /><strong>let&#8217;s keep things in perspective</strong><br /><br />Anyways, so Obie tried to make a funny. I laughed, a little. Okay, I laughest hysterically at the line <em>Java has a compiler. Ruby does not. That's great! Fuck compilers and their false sense of security</em>. That was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IPXM?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00000IPXM">pure, unadulterated George Carlin brilliance</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00000IPXM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.<br /><br />But a <em>lot</em> of people took it seriously and got very offended. That&#8217;s happened to me when I&#8217;ve joked about Java as well. And at the time, I told them to <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/02/program-in-java-you-must-be-joking.html">go soak their head in a toilet</a>.<br /><br />Today I&#8217;m a little more mellow. I just had a delicious, <a href="http://www.merchantsofgreencoffee.com/" title="Merchants of Green Coffee&nbsp;:&nbsp;Home">fresh roasted</a> mug of Costa Rica&#8217;s finest. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393320928?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0393320928">What do we care what Obie Fernandez thinks?</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0393320928" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> We&#8217;d have to be pretty insecure to get outraged when some guy who&#8217;s a drop-out from a consulting firm insults our tool of choice (no deliberate offence intended, I admire people who drop out of the rat race). If you read it and you were amused, great. If you read it and thought it was serious, you could respond. You could ignore it. But why get outraged? For what? One guy&#8217;s <em>opinion</em>?<br /><br />What kind of life is it if we are to walk around all day with our happiness held hostage by people we&#8217;ve never met, just because they have a blog and they write about the things we use?<br /><br />Or do we <em>fear</em> him? Is our manager going to read his list and say &#8220;Oh, what idiots we are to use Java here at BigCo, let&#8217;s switch to Ruby?&#8221; Are we worried that Obie is spreading <em>lies and disinformation</em> that will somehow get us tossed from our cushy jobs? Do we have to get the facts out this very instant before his heresies infect the world?<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t think so.<br /><br />So, my message to everyone, whether you love Ruby, or Java, or both, or <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/09/java-is-right-answer-to-wrong-question.html" title="raganwald: Java is the right answer to the wrong question, Ruby is the wrong answer to the right question">neither</a>, is simple:<br /><br />Peace and Love.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

								<a name="5575229795408082342"></a> 				I'm not the one throwing rocks, but I am the guy tackling the cop when he clubs Obie with a nightstick.<BR/><BR/>But I'm trying to avoid those situations because it feels like such a colossal waste of time.  Admittedly DHH used flame wars to great effect in early Rails marketing, but that only works if you are using others to do your dirty work for you.  The time I've spent involved in flame wars has never once been rewarding in the least, yet I can't deny the perverse addictiveness.<br />

(i.e. it compiles, therefore it works. lol)<BR/><BR/>My response to your post:<BR/><A HREF="http://sablog.com/archives/2007/09/28/its-more-fun-to-be-an-anarchist" REL="nofollow">It's More Fun to be an Anarchist</A> :)<br />

On Amazon.<BR/><BR/>- Not what I expected. <BR/><BR/>This kind of disappointments could lead to feeling cautious about following any links on your blog..<BR/><BR/>Now, I didn't investigate whether the book actually has something to do with this Obie guy, so if it does, then sorry about this rant.<BR/><BR/>But if it doesn't, then I think this is a case of tricking your readers into following links, presumably for some commission from Amazon.<BR/><BR/>I doubt you'd ever push pop-up ads in your readers' faces, but that's just another stop further along on the same road.<br />

								<a name="8360141403895622472"></a> 				Dear anonymous:<BR/><BR/>Thanks for your feedback. I'm sorry that (1) The link was not what you expected, and (2) that you did not find it interesting even if it was unexpected.<BR/><BR/>1. The link is engineered to show a picture of the book and a clear indication that it goes to Amazon. I have no intention of tricking you, just the opposite.<BR/><BR/>2. Have you read it? The book in question is HUGELY relevant to that sentence and to the post as a whole, which is why I linked to it.<BR/><BR/>3. My commissions are so profitable from Amazon that I estimate if I can one hundred blogs like this at once, I can quit my day job. Meaning, I link to Amazon because I feel the books are relevant, not for the money. But as long as I'm linking to the book, I'll take the sixty-five cents if you buy it :-)<br />

Dropping F-bombs is no substitute for correctness, which his article is lacking.  <BR/><BR/>These language wars are what happens when you give emotional children the ability to communicate.  Your post trying to play the intelligent, caring father provides doors to the original posts that other emotional people might have missed so that they can join the idiocy and make it bigger.  The thoughtful folk who read your post are like "WTF?  Who cares about this?" and ignore.<br />

								<a name="8890818280893074044"></a> 				James:<BR/><BR/>Whether it is plausible that he meant every word of his post in stark raving lunatic seriousness is tangential to my point, although I certainly laughed too hard to think it was serious.<BR/><BR/>Nevertheless, my post stands as written. Agree or disagree, that's fine. Take it as humour or construe it as stark raving lunacy. Dispute its facts if you must take time out of your busy day.<BR/><BR/>But why are people <I>angry</I>? This is my question. Do we really want to shorten our lives stressing out over the words someone writes in his blog?<BR/><BR/>I'm just suggesting we put it in perspective. For example, we can turn our attention to <A HREF="http://www.jamesbritt.com/" REL="nofollow">this interesting blog</A>.<br />

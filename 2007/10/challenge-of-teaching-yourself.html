					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Programming as a profession requires a great deal of learning on one&rsquo;s own. Whether you think Universities should or should not be in the business of providing job training for software development, the fact is that the industry moves far too rapidly for Universities to teach more than a small portion of the knowledge required to be competent on the job, even at an entry level.<br /><br /><blockquote>Teaching oneself involves more than just reading a book and playing around, sometimes it involves taking time to investigate the parts that don&#8217;t immediately make sense. (Note that those steps are the shortest, simplest path from confusion to understanding; it might take someone more work than that, but the fact remains that there is a simple and reasonable path to understanding and that it isn&#8217;t particularly hard to find.) If one does not know how to learn on one&#8217;s own, self-teaching is the wrong choice&#8230;</blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">&#8212;Gregory, <a href="http://redcorundum.blogspot.com/2007/10/magic-in-box.html" title="Ruby Discoveries and Idioms: The Magic in the Box">The Magic in the Box</a></div><br /><br />You have to take responsibility for teaching yourself, and that is a far greater responsibility than skimming a book and fooling around copying and pasting code from web pages. You can&#8217;t just take basic or even sketchy knowledge of how to program in one language and &#8220;transfer&#8221; it to another language. You <em>think</em> you can just &#8220;pick it up,&#8221; but in reality you can&#8217;t, and neither can I. Even Peter Norvig needs <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html" title="Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years">ten years</a> to learn a new language.<br /><br /><div class="book"><em><br/><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262062178?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262062178"><img border="0" src="http://raganwald.github.com/uploaded_images/essentials_of_programming_languages.jpg"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262062178" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262062178?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262062178">Essentials of Programming Languages</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262062178" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> introduces programming languages in one of the strongest ways possible: by building a simple interpreter for each language concept (The &ldquo;P.J. Plauger&rdquo; method). There are other important ways to learn a programming language, but none will teach you as much about how language features actually work.<br /><br/></em></div>Returning to the quote, there is a temptation to think of learning a new language or system in terms of your facility with problems you set for yourself. Meaning, you pick up a new language and immediately try to perform some task with it. A task you choose. And you probably have a preconceived idea of how to go about solving the task. And when you have successfully performed that task, you think you have learned the language.<br /><br />When put this way, it is obviously nonsensical. It is like writing a test where you choose the questions.<br /><br />But this type of thinking leads to skirting around or avoiding anything confusing or &#8220;difficult.&#8221; This type of thinking avoids anything truly new and different in favour of using the new language as closely as possible to how you use your existing languages. And that means that you really haven&#8217;t learned anything worthwhile, just some new syntax.<br /><br />To truly learn a new language, you have to learn the different things. When you find something difficult, something that doesn&#8217;t make sense, you don&#8217;t avoid it, <em>you embrace it</em>. This is where the actual learning takes place. For example, it is possible&#8212;even easy&#8212;to write Ruby programs that do not use blocks. They work just like Java programs. But of course, such a program isn&#8217;t really a Ruby program in any substantial sense. If you were to avoid blocks because (a) they look weird, and (b) you can write your program without them, in what sense have you learned how to program in Ruby?<br /><br /><div class="book"><em><hr/><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262162091?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262162091"><img border="0" src="http://raganwald.github.com/uploaded_images/types_and_programming_languages.jpg"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262162091" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262162091?ie=UTF8&tag=raganwald001-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262162091">Types and Programming Languages</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262162091" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> will introduce you to programming languages in a fascinating way: by examining the different type systems behind them.<br /><hr/></em></div><blockquote>Imagine yourself as a master carpenter who is training an aspiring apprentice. The apprentice has assembled some Ikea furniture and decided he likes carpentry, so he&#8217;s going to give it a whirl. One day, he brings in a stool with a leg that needs replacing. He says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to remove the leg, but the screw is just stuck or something, and I think something is wrong with it.&#8221; You look, and ask him to show you how he&#8217;s tried to go about it. He picks up a screwdriver and desperately tries to fit its flat head into the cross of the phillips screw. You tell him to stop, take out a phillips screwdriver, and proceed to unscrew things easily. He gawks and asks, &#8220;There are different kinds of screws that need to be treated differently?&#8221;<br />  <br />  Imagine your horror. How could he not know something so basic? Aspiring to be a carpenter requires understanding the tools a carpenter uses. Likewise, aspiring to be a programmer requires understanding the tools a programmer uses. [ibid]</blockquote><br />When learning a new language or tool, do not shy away from things that seem different, weird, confusing, counter-intuitive, or unfamiliar. Do not put them off because you can work around them. Learn them, try them, and persist with them until you discover <em>why</em> they make sense. This is the true road to teaching yourself a new language. And in today&#8217;s fast-moving industry, it&#8217;s a road we all share.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

								<a name="5042980660856868655"></a> 				I like your Java Ruby example.  A big problem of programming Ruby in a Java like fashion is that the programmer will have immense difficulty understanding any source code or example code from the core Ruby library or key 3rd party libraries.  And without being able to leverage that, your output would be fairly poor.<br />

								<a name="4444650801103696839"></a> 				Every new languages I've learned was to solve a particular problem. PHP makes web programming easy, Perl is good for text, etc. Here's the thing: I'd like to learn either a functional language or a lisp variant. The problem is that so far, I haven't found any problem that I can solve efficiently with them that I cannot do with  c, c++, java, perl, python, php, shell scripts, etc. I suspect a lot of people are like me in this respect and find that the best way to learn a language is to solve a problem that would be too difficult (or too time-consumming) to do in other languages.<BR/><BR/>Any advice for people like me? Or are we going at it totally wrong?<br />

								<a name="98512553413384053"></a> 				I agree with you dfd.  The easiest way for me to learn (or at least "pick up") a new language is to take a problem and try to solve it.<BR/>Of course I wouldn't claim to be an expert or even an advanced coder of that language after only one project, but I would definitely have learned enough of it to be able to tackle more problems with it.<BR/>I would say you can learn a language by taking on a project in it, and depending on the complexity of the project and how much you try to learn the specific features of the language will correlate with how much of the language you actually learn.  It's basically up to you how much of the language you want to learn, by how much of the language you are willing to explore.<br />

								<a name="4986884851938300328"></a> 				I followed the advice in the pragmatic programmers books of learning a new language every year, I've actually learned more than one every year, but in the spirit of your article, I'd rather say that it's not the new syntax that I'm looking for, but the new paradigm, or the exceptional part in every language that makes it particular. <BR/>Sometimes, you open a door into a completely new world. <BR/>For example I've never heard of Haskell a year before, and discovering this language was like opening "la boite de pandore". I found my self digging into things like type theory, categories, proofs, semantics, combinatory logic, and I'm actually reading MacLanes's Algebra. I've been always working in "Enterprise Software", and I can't say that I'm using the knowledge I'm gathering by following the path of every new paradigm I learn in each new language, I'd rather not talk about it in my working environment to avoid the label of the weird guy, but what I'm learning is evidently making me a better programmer, a better problem solver.<BR/><BR/>Other languages which I find interesting : Scala(pi and join calculus, Actors, FP and OOP, mixins, pattern matching, type inference, closures, DSL, implicit defs , type constructors ..)  , Perl 6 ( hyper operators, junctions, first class Grammars, .. ), Oz (dataflow, + many things from the above ..)<br />

								<a name="3817497023733219007"></a> 				This is the first time in almost 2 years of reading your blog that I've felt the drive to comment. :)<BR/><BR/>I prefer to distinguish "learning" a language from "mastering" it -- primarily to disempower people who insist that they "cannot learn to program".<BR/><BR/>Learning to program, in any language, is not much different from learning to drive or learning to cook; there are shades of success. Could any one of us go out today and win a NASCAR (or similar) event? Would we pass muster as Head Chef in one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurant? Probably not.<BR/><BR/>"First, you need to learn to think. That's going to be the hard part. Once you know how to think, you only need to spend a short while with any language to learn the syntax, and you can program in that language. It's that first one that trips everyone up."<br />

Learning had better be less than mastery: if they are the same thing, I haven't learned to program yet.<BR/><BR/>But w.r.t. my argument, you cannot ride a bicycle, then climb into a car and figure out how to drive on your own after playing around in a parking lot.<BR/><BR/>Sure, you grasp the differences from a bicycle in terms of steering, accelerating, and braking.<BR/><BR/>But to be able to drive in traffic you are going to need to learn a set of skills that are different than a bicycle, such as how blind spots work, the different braking behaviour, under- and -oversteering, drift when you take your hands off the wheel, and so forth.<BR/><BR/>These are not obvious if you simply try to translate your bicycle skills to driving an automobile.<BR/><BR/>I think your suggestion that learning is less than mastering is apt, but nevertheless it is far more than figuring out how to do something that is well within your comfort zone.<br />

								<a name="1301656980469430562"></a> 				I've had a similar experience to dfd.  Each language and development tool has a particular strength and reason for being.  I get by doing most of my personal work in Rebol ( http://musiclessonz.com/rebol_tutorial.html ), but a little PHP can often help with web site scripts, a little VB and an existing Com component can provide a simple solution to a complex desktop problem, Python on my pocket PC provides a great toolbox for lots of useful little data processing tasks.  I've always been compelled to learn new tools that are right for the job, just because there's a need for an effective solution.  Every language is an abstraction layer, built upon other layers of abstraction.  You use HTML, Javascript, etc. to build web sites because the web browser is the environment in which that level of abstraction occurs.  There's no place for assembly code in that environment.  Likewise, device drivers may be written in assembly, and there's no place for a scripting language at that level.  I think that's how language learning should be presented:  here are the available tools, these are their strengths and weaknesses, and here's why each specific tool is used for a given need, in a given environment.<br />

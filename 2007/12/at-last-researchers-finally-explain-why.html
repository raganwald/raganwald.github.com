								<a name="4179768934224256004"></a> 				Please don't feel discouraged in what you do here. I am sympathetic to the difficulty of presenting an idea as clearly as possible in one's blog or comment, and some folks are gifted enough to do an excellent job at that, including yourself.<BR/><BR/>Sometimes what I write comes about as negative, vitriolic, trollish, filled with Grammar errors on top of that. Not to mention that it could come slightly off-topic and not in a conversational tone.<BR/><BR/>You Mr., by your turn, gets it about right. Keep it up! Regards from Brazil!<BR/><BR/>P.S. My blog sucks. Just today I started a blog with this subject: "I figure I better give Flex 3 a serious try". And then I wrote what I wanted about it. Soon after messing with Flex a bit, I deleted the content of the post, replacing it with: "Or not..." Take that as an example. :-)<br />

We at that point where a PhD doesn't necessarily mean more or less 'accurate' knowledge about how to build software than thirty years of hands-on experience. <BR/><BR/>If you put these two up against each other their knowledge, understanding, practices and advice will be completely different and might not even overlap. Would you take the advice of one over the other?

					<div style="clear:both;"></div>Write code that works.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s all, you write working code. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter what degree you have, what courses you took, or whose blogs you read. It&rsquo;s all about the code.<br /><br />Joel, I hear what you&rsquo;re saying about knowing what a pointer is and understanding the byzantine Windows API. But still, if someone write a program, I say he&rsquo;s a programmer.<br /><br />Steve, you&rsquo;re preaching to the choir. Yeah boy, programming without understanding how programming languages really work is like painting with the brush held between the toes of one foot. But I think it&rsquo;s still programming.<br /><br /><div class="book"><hr><em><a id="lnx0" name="evtst|a|0596510047" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596510047?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0596510047"><img src="http://raganwald.github.com/uploaded_images/beautiful_code.jpg" border="0"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596510047" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1"><br><br>In <a name="evtst|a|0596510047" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596510047?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0596510047">Beautiful Code</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596510047" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1">, great programmers share their thinking process with us. And that&rsquo;s why this book transcends so many other books about programming: thinking and problem solving approaches are universal. This isn&rsquo;t a book about programs, it&rsquo;s a book about programming: every page turned will make you a better programmer.<br /></em><hr></div>And you over there, the one who just wants a job as a programmer, the one who wants to do whatever everybody is doing and wants to learn as little as possible to get things done. You&rsquo;re a programmer, don&rsquo;t let any Chablis-swilling pretentious art-house blogger tell you otherwise between their rants about why we should still be using Lisp or Smalltalk.<br /><br />All these other things, be they type theory, agile practices, compilers, pointers, DSLs, or anything else&hellip; These are all tools. Ignorance of those tools is not helpful. I think you will be <em>even better</em> with more knowledge. I think you will be <em>happier</em> if you learn how to &ldquo;cut with the grain&rdquo; and work with the principles of software development instead of against them. But even if you decide you can&rsquo;t be bothered with anything hard, the important thing is that you write programs, therefore you are a programmer.<br /><br />I don&rsquo;t want to wake up one day and find there&rsquo;s a required reading course for being a programmer (even if my blog is on the list). I don&rsquo;t want <em>anyone</em> deciding who is&mdash;and who isn&rsquo;t&mdash;fit to be a programmer. <a title="The Optimistic View" href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/11/i-think-it-funny-that-aspects-were.html">I want everyone to be free to program</a>. The price of that freedom is that yes, some people are going to do things I don&rsquo;t like. But you can&rsquo;t build a world with room for Ruby unless there&rsquo;s room for PHP. You cannot build a world with room for Scala unless you build a world with room for Java.<br /><br />Now, does that mean that when Steve Yegge talks about why you ought to know how compilers work, everyone ought to shout him down and say that compiler architecture and/or programming language implementation is bullshit? No. I will be the first to say that compilers and language implementation are important. I will rant.<br /><br />I support your individual choice of what to learn and what to skip as a programmer. Agree or disagree with me, I say you&rsquo;re a programmer and I measure how good you are by what you do with the knowledge you decide to acquire. But I still believe that there are such things as fundamentals. There are things that every programmer would do well to know. There are things that would make everybody&rsquo;s lives easier if every programmer knew them.<br /><br /><blockquote>Fundamentals matter, because although you are a programmer without them, you could be a much better programmer with them</blockquote><br />I do say that you can program without the fundamentals, but I will never say that they are irrelevant, that we have passed the day when fundamentals matter. They <em>do</em> matter, because although you are a programmer without them, you could be a much better programmer with them.<br /><br />But you will still be a programmer.<br /><br /><hr/><br /><em><font size="2">Elsewhere, I see some folks are arguing whether writing HTML is programming or not. To questions like that, I have but one response: give me an objective definition of what is and what isn&rsquo;t a program, and I&rsquo;ll give you an objective definition of what is and isn&rsquo;t programming.</font></em><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

								<a name="1793098847312838539"></a> 				I see.  I think my own view is starting to form in my mind now that you mentioned the legislated professions.  Let me try again.<BR/><BR/>I may not accept someone telling me they are a programmer unless they demonstrate a certain proficiency in programming and/or peers would call them a programmer.<BR/><BR/>I'll try to explain.  I don't think you need a degree to be a programmer (or anyone's Official approval for that matter).  I don't think you need a license to practice as a mechanic.  And the list goes on.<BR/><BR/>Along those lines, I wouldn't call myself a mechanic if I only changed my oil.  But if I did have enough experience changing various parts and diagnosing problems with the car, I might start to consider myself one.  <BR/><BR/>Nailing some boards together into a box that I attach to the wall as a cabinet wouldn't make me a carpenter.  I'd need to demonstrate some skill to call myself that.<BR/><BR/>So certainly I am programming when I puts "hello world", (among other things unrelated to typing), but am I a programmer?<BR/><BR/>I guess my view is more strict than your own, but it is much less strict than the posts you referenced.<br />

I'm not trying to be elitist (that I know of), and I don't know if I'm coming across that way.<BR/><BR/>A programmer by dictionary definition is "one who programs" and I agree that a quality of a program would be that it works.   <BR/><BR/>There can be no more liberal or inviting definition than that.

You need a bunch of very specialised experts to bang their heads together to get a project like that off the ground.<BR/><BR/>It's not a boolean argument. You're not either a programmer or not a programmer.<BR/><BR/>You wouldn't hire Joe Bloggs the Backyard Doghouse Builder to make your skyscraper.

For most professions, either licensed or not, there seems to be a fairly clear divide between professional and amateur: you are so good at what you do that other people are willing to pay you to do it for them.  You are this good because you learned from others who have very well defined, effective techniques. It feels like in the programming field, having the most basic amateur skill level can still qualify you for professional status. I think many people are constantly thinking about this, are bothered by this, because we want to develop as professionals (skilled practitioners who do a good job) and we want to develop the profession.  I think professional programmers (at least this professional programmer) wants their field to work more like that of a professional carpenter than of a desk clerk :-).<br />

								<a name="8736493869105172512"></a> 				There's a difference between "is a" and "knows how to."  It's fundamental.<BR/><BR/>If I wanted to record a top notch guitar performance, I would look for a guitarist.  I would not ask around for somebody who knows how to play guitar.<BR/><BR/>If I wanted somebody to fix my expensive car, I would look for a mechanic.  I would not ask around for somebody who works on cars.<BR/><BR/>If I wanted a program to manage my business, I would look for a programmer.  I would not ask around for somebody who knows how to program.<BR/><BR/>Context is everything.  A mechanic is somebody who works on cars but somebody who works on cars is not necessarily a mechanic.  A programmer is somebody who writes programs but somebody who writes programs is not necessarily a programmer.<BR/><BR/>This entire discussion is a bit juvenile though.  It's pretty lame for anyone to attack somebody for not being a "programmer" (e.g. living up to the attacker's superior skills).  Likewise, it's pretty lame for someone to insist that he be called a programmer if other people in the programming profession recognize that he is not a programmer by profession.<BR/><BR/>Introducing yourself with a professional title assumes that you are actively pursuing that profession.  That doesn't mean that you have to be working in the profession, necessarily, but it does mean that you define yourself as a "programmer" or "mechanic" or "guitarist."  If you aren't any good at the profession and/or aren't actively pursuing it with great passion, then everybody else will recognize that you're just full of yourself.<BR/><BR/>Personally, I wouldn't call myself a programmer unless I considered myself an expert or someone approaching expert level in at least one aspect of programming.  That is, I would have to feel confident that I could not only solve most problems thrown my way, but that I could solve them efficiently and in a manner understandable by my colleagues. <BR/><BR/>Simply writing a program that works does not automatically grant one recognition as a programmer.  If that was true, then I'm a programmer, designer, chef, guitarist, doctor, mechanic, carpenter, mason, farmer, writer, jockey, dog trainer, runner, teacher, student, weight lifter, diplomat, manager, critic, janitor, driver, biker, counselor, photographer, window washer, sinner, saint, consultant, lawyer, accountant, machine operator, bus boy, landscaper.  I'm gonna need  some new cards printed up.<br />

								<a name="561677355166196300"></a> 				I understand where you're coming from, but this is a problem of semantics.  You can't simply decide to throw away all other interpretations of a word simply because it makes things easier.  That would require that we all agree with your assessment, and we don't, and we're back to square one.  <BR/><BR/>This problem has no solution.  Even my argument is easily invalidated by you not agreeing with it. <BR/><BR/>Who gets to decide who's right?  Everybody, nobody, me, you.  This is a question that applies to every aspect of our lives.  Who gets to make the rules, what does fair mean, what does competent mean, where do we draw all of our imaginary lines?  There is no definitive answer that works for all cases, and you certainly won't find an answer by reducing all definitions to their most open interpretations and then claiming to do so because nobody has the right (another word open to interpretation) to do otherwise.<BR/><BR/>My solution to this problem is to define a programmer as someone who spends the majority of his time and passion writing programs and striving to improve his skills, including his ability to work with other programmers.  Really this most likely means that the person writes software for a living.  At any rate, this model seems to fit with most of the cases in which the title of programmer is used, in my own personal experience.  If I told you that I was looking to hire a programmer, you would not assume that I would be considering somebody who has written a working "hello world."<BR/><BR/>Your argument about Java doesn't make much sense to me.  When I speak of my colleagues, I'm not talking about every programmer in the world.  It should not be expected that a programmer know the ins and outs of every single programming language.  Besides the fact that a language is just one of many development tools, a person practicing in a field should not have to be an expert in all areas.  People specialize.<BR/><BR/>Thus, if I wrote some Java code and my colleagues (e.g. co-developers and/or trusted reviewers) can't understand why the hell I implemented something in a certain way, then I probably wrote some bad code, regardless of whether it works given some input.  This doesn't automatically exclude me from being a programmer, it just means that I did a poor job.  If, on the other hand, most of my work was at this level, then perhaps I'm not qualified to be working as a programmer, and I've got some work to do to get up to par.<BR/><BR/>Cars are all fundamentally the same under the hood.  Slightly different variations on the same theme.  A mechanic can diagnose the majority of problems with any car, and knows when he needs to hand the job over or get advice from somebody with more experience in a particular aspect of the vehicle's implementation.  He can solve most problems well enough, and doesn't use any bubble gum.  When the next mechanic opens the hood, he's not going to say "what the hell is this??"  The same is true of programmers and programming languages and computers themselves.  <BR/><BR/>Anyhow, no, I can't restrict someone from calling himself a programmer.  It's not morally or legally correct to do so.  It wouldn't be worth my time anyhow.  I am, however, going to maintain my standard and interpretation of the title of programmer because it fits best with my experiences and communication with others.<BR/><BR/>It's a matter of "I know it when I see it."<br />

								<a name="1623168811017161767"></a> 				I haven't read all the comments, but I liken programming to any art.  Just because I get up in front of a microphone does not make me a singer.  Just because I sit in a coffee house with a laptop and write poetry does not make me a poet.  Saying that there is no prerequisite for being a programmer is about as ridiculous as saying there is no prereq for anything else.  I also fail to see how starting something makes you ahead of anybody who hasn't tried.  That presupposes that just by trying something, it gives you innate talent.  Do you watch American idol?  Are those rejects singers because they tried?  Are they more of a singer than me because they went on TV and made a fool of themselves?  I guess your argument is that even though they suck, they got "experience" from the process.  I still don't buy into that.  I've watched many "programmers" get "experience" from all the wrong places and put crappy code into production.  I think that makes them a worker whose job is to program...not a programmer.<br />

								<a name="7319874569822339162"></a> 				Folks:<BR/><BR/>With that, comments are <B>closed</B> on this post. If you wish to carry on the debate, please do so from the comfort of your own weblogs.<BR/><BR/>As mentioned many, many times, I am an egalitarian. That does not mean I hire anyone, or use any piece of software. I own several Macintoshes, I am not the type of person to suffer poorly written operating systems without protest.<BR/><BR/>I understand where you are coming from, and it boils down to one of two things: By programmer, you really mean good programmer, or professional programmer. That I understand. Or, by programmer, you mean someone who you think is like you and not someone who is not like you. That I also understand.<BR/><BR/>However, I am closing the discussion because it is not actually interesting. I urge you to re-read the post and see if you can figure out what it is actually about. In your zeal to debate who is and who isn&rsquo;t fit to program, you may have missed the thesis of the post.<br />

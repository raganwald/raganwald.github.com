					<div style="clear:both;"></div>On Monday of this week, I began an experiment. I stopped looking up Ruby and Rails information in my PDF of the second edition of <a id="lnx1" name="evtst|a|0974514055" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0974514055?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0974514055">Programming Ruby</a> and in the excellent <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/" title="Rails Framework Documentation">on-line documentation for Rails</a>. Every time my fingers twitched to do a search, I reached for an actual dead-tree book instead. Not one of those quick references designed for looking things up, but a book where the author actually teaches the material.<br /><br />I have been looking things up using the stone-age technology of a good index. And then I&#8217;ve been reading actual explanations, not just copying code snippets off the &#8216;net and pasting them into my programs.<br /><br />&#8230;<em>It&#8217;s Friday afternoon and neither you nor I want to slog through a heavy essay, so let&#8217;s just flip right through the pages of metaphors and anecdotal examples from my own experience. Imagine for a moment that there were a number of really insightful remarks, a few good quotes from other bloggers or authors, and a couple of great code samples. Since we&rsquo;re in a hurry, let&#8217;s jump right to the end:</em>&#8230;<br /><br />So in conclusion, if you just want to get something done quickly without gaining a fuller, deeper understanding, by all means use a <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-cheat-sheet-734.html" title="Ruby Cheat Sheets">cheat sheet</a>. But if you want to actually learn more about what you&#8217;re using, the next time you need to look something up, don&#8217;t go to the cheat sheet, Don&#8217;t Google it. Look it up in an actual book like <a id="lnx0" name="evtst|a|0672328844" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672328844?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0672328844">The Ruby Way</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0672328844" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1"> or its equally informative companion <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321445619?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321445619">The Rails Way</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=raganwald001-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321445619" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. It may take a moment longer, and you can&#8217;t copy and paste. But a good book contains far more than an explanation of <em>what</em> to do. It shows <em>how</em> it works, <em>when</em> to do that, and <em>why</em> it works that way. <br /><br />A good book is going to answer a question you didn&rsquo;t know needed to be asked. It&rsquo;s tough for a busy programmer to find time to read books from cover to cover and learn the material. But every time you need to look something up, you have a golden opportunity to research the material instead of cheating the answer. Use those opportunities to learn: That knowledge is going to make you a better programmer.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

								<a name="3917769809892849847"></a> 				I imposed a strict rule on myself years ago: I never write code I don't understand. I still use cheat sheets,  but I use them as fast ways to find the material I need to learn. When I find what I want, if I don't immediately understand it, I head off to irb and play with it until I do. Takes more time, but as you point out, the goal is not efficiency, but effectiveness.<br />

								<a name="3137863413860816623"></a> 				You don't need to be ashamed at learning from a book, Reg. :-)<BR/><BR/>Take this all with a grain of salt. Ruby is the the first adventure for me into "unexplored territory". Normally I have the advantage of learning established (CS) subjects, and taking the advice of the Internet for the best book on a given subject. Ruby is pretty immature right now. <BR/><BR/>My company recently transitioned to Ruby + Rails, so we have a collection of Ruby books laying around. I've read or flipped through the Pick Axe book, The Ruby Way, and The Ruby Cookbook. I learned something from each, but I wouldn't qualify any of them as good. I probably learned the most from the chapter on the C interface in the pickaxe book.<BR/><BR/>I think the issue of "hand-wavy" Ruby books is partly the result of the Ruby culture. In Agile Web Development w/ Rails, there is a sidebar that goes something like "Q: How does this all work? A: It's Magic! You don't want to invite people who don't believe in magic to Christmas". <BR/><BR/>Because the culture values the "feel" of the language more than having a spec, the books are all sort of vague. I guess that's sort of ok for quick web development, but it doesn't really make me feel comfortable about doing "real" work with the language. <BR/><BR/><BR/>Sorry for the rant/tangent. This commenting thing is fun. I should start my own blog. :-)<br />

								<a name="9133069013240634629"></a> 				<I>One of the amazing things about it all is that "Cut and Paste" people can provide actual value to their bosses or customers.</I><BR/><BR/>I am not amazed: doing a quick lookup in a cheat sheet is always faster than researching something in more depth. if researching something saves you a lot of time on that task, it's an immediate win and yoiu are faster. But sometimes it doesn't pay off until you are doing some other task, where you were guided by what you learned researching this task.<BR/><BR/>Meaning, it is often an investment in the long term, not the short term. That is a very difficult investment to make, most people cannot or will not consistently invest in themselves, and most businesses have this trouble as well.<BR/><BR/>Tangent, I know, but it reminds me of the Java Closures debate that is descending into a farce. Deciding whether to leave closures out of Java because programmers may have trouble understanding them is a classic case of sacrificing the long term for the short term.<BR/><BR/>Hopefully nobody is saying that Java programmers are too stupid to understand them, just that nobody thinks learning them is worth the effort.<BR/><BR/>Seems like teh same thing to me.<br />

So, I not only try to learn as much as I can about what I am "borrowing" but also I try to explain things that to many more experienced people might seem obvious at first glance.<BR/><BR/>A kind of "pay it forward" approach<br />

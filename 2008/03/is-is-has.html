					<div style="clear:both;"></div><blockquote>All of the pain caused by inheritance can be traced back to the fact that inheritance forces &#8216;is-a&#8217; rather than &#8216;has-a&#8217; relationships. If class R2Unit extends Droid, then a R2Unit is-a Droid. If class Jedi contains an instance variable of type Lightsabre, then a Jedi has-a Lightsabre.<br />  <br />  The difference between is-a and has-a relationships is well known and a fundamental part of OOAD, but what is less well known is that almost every is-a relationship would be better off re-articulated as a has-a relationship.</blockquote><div>&#8212;Bernie Sumption, <a href="http://www.berniecode.com/writing/inheritance/" title="Inheritance is evil, and must be destroyed: part 1">Inheritance is evil, and must be destroyed</a></div><br />I&#8217;m in the middle of dealing with some ActiveRecord, um, &#8216;features,&#8217; so I don&#8217;t have time to write an interesting, thoughtful essay. Nor do I have time to write an overly long and meandering essay as Raganwald readers have come to expect. So instead, let&#8217;s pretend there&#8217;re six or seven closely typewritten pages of self-indulgent bloggery leading up to&#8230;<br /><br /><strong>IS-A IS-A HAS-A</strong><br /><br />When classical OO languages (including Ruby and Java) implement inheritance, what actually happens is this: First, the subclass acquires the interface of the superclass (latently typed languages like Ruby don&#8217;t do this explicitly, but it is still true). Second, under the hood where you can&#8217;t see it, the compiler makes room for a reference to the superclass and arranges for methods that the subclass does not implement to be delegated to the superclass.<br /><br />In other words, whenever you declare that Child IS-A Person, the compiler writes &#8220;Child HAS-A Person&#8221; and &#8220;Child BEHAVES-LIKE-A Person&#8221; and &#8220;Child DELEGATES-TO Person&#8221; for you.<br /><br />The right way to look at single inheritance is therefore that it is a <em>specialization</em> of composition. Like all specializations, it does less. It is more specific. And therefore, when it is exactly what you mean to accomplish, it is more useful: you need fewer lines of code to express it, the compiler optimizes the relationship for you, and since it is a very well-known idiom, it expresses your intent clearly to other programmers.<br /><br />On the other hand, when single inheritance is not exactly what you mean to express, you have two choices: you can greenspun some more general feature out of it, adding accidental complexity to your code and making it less readable, or you can use the more general purpose, flexible tool: composition.<br /><br />Like all Golden Hammers, seeing every OO problem as a single inheritance nail leads to trouble. Single inheritance is probably Turing Equivalent: given enough determination, you can probably write any arbitrary program if you are prepared to twist your code into knots as it bows down and sacrifices readability to the inheritance demon.<br /><br />However, breaking free of its grip is simple: you need only see inheritance as a tool like any other tool: it is not superior to the others at your disposal. It is not the goal. A nice pyramid of classes and subclasses is not your objective when you set out to design a program. When you see it as just another chapter in the book, you see when to use it and when to set it aside.<br /><br />And in fact, if you see it as a particularly <em>thin</em> chapter in the book, you may be surprised how much easier it is to work with OO programs. And if you see it as a couple of pages in the chapter on composition and delegation&hellip; you will be on the road to understanding.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

								<a name="4137114010916884824"></a> 				I often think of single inheritance as a rapid prototyping tool for class design.  Even when I know that I'll eventually want composition (maybe so that I can stick in States and Strategies and Decorate them), it's just so darn easy to type and think about single inheritance.  Then I can quickly get my feet wet in the problem domain, and later refactor my classes into composition and delegation patterns, once I've got a better feel for their contracts with each other.<br />

								<a name="591539597082714249"></a> 				IS-A IS-NOT HAS-A.<BR/><BR/>What the compiler does is purely an implementation detail -- sometimes useful for understanding the semantics, sometimes plain misleading. In a has-a relation the 'subclass' cannot overload the 'superclass' methods to change the behaviour of the superclass; it can't delegate back. (And those are the method that may best be 'protected'.)<BR/><BR/>Whether modifying the base class behaviour by overriding its methods is a good idea? At least it's usually a documentation nightmare as the base class needs to make very specific what can or must not be done. java.lang.Classloader is such a skimpy case. There are also namespace issues; call your java method wait(), and funny things <I>may</I> happen.<BR/><BR/>Also unfortunately the modern languages don't have a mechanisms to make the distinction between HAS-A and KNOWS-A; between a 1:1 relation between sub and super and a 1:n relation to a shared object. C(++) makes that possible by the distinction between objects as members and references/pointers to other objects; including the automatic initialization. (Not that I particularly like C++, this is just one of its better corners.)<BR/><BR/>Inheritance is for reusing implementation; for just implementing the same interface we (the static type gang) nowadays have, ahem, interfaces. In C++ both run under the same heading, and make multiple inheritance much more a need.<BR/><BR/>HAS-A subobjects sometimes need to callback to the having object; think timers for example. In C++ this is much easier by providing a timer class having a abstract virtual method for the callback than to call a method on another object. That is why there are private base classes there.<BR/><BR/>And for the last tangent... C++ actually has duck typing. In templates.<br />

								<a name="5645041841728350290"></a> 				Technically, you're correct.  But, in statically typed languages, there's an implication that if you inherit from another class, you're a specialization of that class (for some handwave definition of "specialization).  If your behavior screws up, it's assumed to be a fault of the library, because you've violated this development convention.<BR/><BR/>In implicitly typed languages, since I don't really know anything about the class information, I can't make that (possibly erroneous) assumption.  And so I (as the user of the code) need to check to make sure your code behaves the way I expect it to behave, not only at development time but as a runtime piece of safety.<br />

I prefer the "Strict" interpretation of the Liskov Principle, meaning essentially that if I have a class C I can write a collection of unit tests for that class. Now if I specialize it to create D < C (Ruby nomenclature) or D extends C (Java nomenclature), I must be able to run all of my C tests on D objects and they all pass.<BR/><BR/>This implies forcefully not to override behaviour of concrete classes. Extend it, but not override it.<BR/><BR/>So if I override a method, it is only to add new bahaviour, such as handling new options, not to change existing behaviour.<BR/><BR/>This is not the only or best way to do things, but it lets me sleep at night whether I'm using Java, Smalltalk, or Ruby.<br />

But I've been running across cases where it seems like it didn't even occur to the author that he or she could extend a class by inheriting and overriding a method or two; instead, they chose to re-open the class and overwrite the offending methods.<BR/><BR/>Not that inheritance is necessarily the <EM>best</EM> form of class extension for all cases; but it's usually an improvement on method overwriting.<br />

If Rails wants a Logger object that behaves this way, it should subclass Logger, or inject its own Logger::Formatter into the picture rather than this mess.<BR/><BR/>What this accomplishes is utterly evil. If you’re adding things to a rails app that expect Logger to behave as documented, you’ll configure your logging date formats all day long and never have any impact. Worse, the code is flagged :nodoc:, so after screwing around with expected behavior, we’re left with no indication as to why a Logger instance created from the Rails console will behave different than a Logger created from IRB.<BR/><BR/>Mixins are a great feature of Ruby, but a mixin that irrevocably alters a core library class just to avoid the minor pain of creating a proper subclass where it it obviously necessary is just plain wrong, no matter how $!#^$% pragmatic you’re claiming to be.</I><br />

I said use it when it is what you mean. That means you get to decide, it is not a popularity contest.<BR/><BR/>There's no particularly good definition for a lot of things in some programming languages. What does protected inheritance mean in C++? When should you use if and when should you use unless in Ruby?<BR/><BR/>Quite frankly, consensus on these things often boil down to whether someone has written a book telling you what it ought to mean, like the GoF did with Design Patterns.<BR/><BR/>If the book is easy to read, and comes along at just the right time when a new language is taking off, and the planets are aligned just so, a great mass of people will parrot its contents without any idea of what it means.<BR/><BR/>And then we can truthfully say that there is agreement on what such-and-such means, because we have confidence that someone else will recognize it.<BR/><BR/>In the mean time, <I>I</I> will go along my own way just deciding what it ought to mean in a particular code base given the constraints on that particular code and the things that code needs to do.<BR/><BR/>I guess I embrace TIMTOWTDI. You may not, you may prefer that everything has exactly one meaning everyone agrees on.<br />

								<a name="2949652855660597633"></a> 				Robert:<BR/><BR/>Meaning is such a big word. There is "I meant to do that," meaning (ha) that you want a certain result, and the code means no more and no less than whatever it happened to do.<BR/><BR/>Almost all software is deterministic enough that it always has that kind of meaning with exactitude.<BR/><BR/>Another meaning of "meaning" is something along the following lines: you have in your mind a set of constraints on the design of the software, such that you can look at the software and decide whether it is consistent with your constraints or not.<BR/><BR/>So--for example--if you decide that inheritance "means" Liskoiv equivalence in a strong sense, then  you might see "A is-a B" in one part of the code. But later you see a place where A is modified such that it cannot substitute for B, and you feel this violates the meaning of A is-a B.<BR/><BR/>If that is your model for "meaning," then the expression "exact meaning" describes the precision of your test for consistency.<BR/><BR/>if there are a lot of places where you say "this is mostly consistent," or "sorta wrong," then you do not have an exact meaning.<BR/><BR/>What I was trying to say earlier is that  there is a third sense of "exact meaning," which is the One Way vs. Many Ways argument. This is a little orthogonal: if tehre are many programmers, each of whom have an exact meaning for "is-a" in the sense above, but their meanings are different, some people say there is no exact meaning.<BR/><BR/>That is a third sense of meaning, a sense of consensus.<BR/><BR/>Any ways, I am trying to say that I have strong opinions about IS-A in the second sense, I believe you can  establish a concrete standard on a team or on a code base. I agree that there is lively debate across teams and programmers. And I agree that matters very much  to the people who want there to be one way to do it.<br />

Although<BR/>these two interpretations appear contradictory, there is truth in both — but not from the<BR/>same perspective.<BR/><BR/>It all depends on whether you look at a class as a type or a module. In the first<BR/>case, inheritance, or is, is clearly specialization; “dog” is a more specialized notion than<BR/>“animal”, and “rectangle” than “polygon”. This corresponds, as noted, to subset inclusion:<BR/>if B is heir to A, the set of run-time objects represented by B is a subset of the<BR/>corresponding set for A.<BR/>But from the module perspective, where a class is viewed as a provider of services, B<BR/>implements the services (features) of A plus its own. Fewer objects often allows more<BR/>features, since it implies a higher information value; going from arbitrary animals to dogs<BR/>we can add the specific property of barking, and from arbitrary polygons to rectangles we<BR/>can add the feature diagonal. So with respect to features implemented the subsetting goes<BR/>the other way: the features applicable to instances of A are a subset of those for instances of B.<BR/>Inheritance, then, is specialization from the type viewpoint and extension from the<BR/>module viewpoint. This is the extension-specialization paradox: more features to apply,<BR/>hence fewer objects to apply them to.<br />

								<a name="4916684821129969402"></a> 				The biggest problem with favoring composition over inheritance is that, while it is a well-known and generally accepted principle, I have yet to see a mainstream programming language that makes composition as easy as inheritance, even though it really wouldn't be a difficult language feature to implement. This results in mediocre and/or deadline-constrained programmers using inheritance instead of composition just so they don't have to pound out all the manual delegation code.<br />

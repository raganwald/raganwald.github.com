The Ruby Way contains more than four hundred examples explaining how to do everything from distributing Ruby to functional programming techniques like the Y combinator.</em><hr></div>The author of this code was an <em>Agnostic</em>. He didn&rsquo;t mind using a case statement instead of if-elsif-elsif, he paid attention to the features of his chosen programming language, but he didn&rsquo;t have strong convictions about there being One True Way to express every set of choices.<br /><br />His code &ldquo;Just Worked.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Donning The Hair Shirt</strong><br /><br />The Agnostic&rsquo;s code carried on, quietly working, until one day another programmer chanced upon it. Our second programmer was an <em>Ascetic</em>. Ascetics believe in code that can do powerful things with a small set of core axioms, like recursion and first-class functions.<br /><br />The Ascetic spotted a bug: What if &ldquo;digits&rdquo; only had <em>two</em> digits? The objective of the code was clearly to have at least five digits, with leading zeros. The Ascetic cracked his knuckles and went to work.<br /><br />Given his <a title="Tom Moertel derives the Y combinator in Ruby" href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/02/guest-blogger-tom-moertel-derives-y.html">favourite library function</a>:<br /><pre><code><br />def y(&f)<br />    lambda { |x| x[x] } [ <br />        lambda { |yf| lambda { |*args| f[yf[yf]][*args] } } ]<br />end</code></pre><br />He rewrote the Agnostic&rsquo;s code as:<br /><pre><code><br />def formatted_zip_code(digits)<br />  y { |rec|<br />    lambda { |str| <br />      str =~ /....(.)+/ && str || rec["0#{str}"] } }[digits]<br />end</code></pre><br />And all was well for a short time.<br /><br /><strong>Toiling in the Stacks</strong><br /><br />The Ascetic checked his code in, where another programmer, a <em>Librarian</em>, reviewed it. She saw immediately that it could and should be re-written:<br /><pre><code><br />def formatted_zip_code(digits)<br />  digits.rjust(5,'0')<br />end</code></pre><br />Librarians believe that there is a library for everything, and good languages have huge libraries providing lots of built-in functionality. Programming is the art of searching the libraries for the one magic incantation that does exactly what you want.<br /><br />And for a short time, all continued to be well.<br /><br /><strong>Purity of Essence</strong><br /><br />One day, management hired a senior programmer with much experience working in the bowels of BigCo. He was brought in to provide &ldquo;Adult Supervision&rdquo; for the programming team. He went right to work, reviewing the code base and compiling a list of sins against his religious convictions. He was an <em>OO Purist</em>.<br /><br /><blockquote>I am told that a cathedral built by Purists is beautiful to behold, constructed lovingly of small bricks, no more than 50 lines per class, no more than 10 classes per package, no more than two instance variables per class, no more than one level of indentation per method, no more than one dot per line, and absolutely no else clauses.</blockquote><br /><br />The Purist considered ifs, cases, and even shortcut booleans to be deficiencies in code, places where the proper approach&mdash;and indeed to only approach&mdash;is to use polymorphism and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type">dependent types</a>.<br /><br />The Purist seized upon the twice-rewritten code as an opportunity to show how such a thing ought to be written:<br /><pre><code><br />def formatted_zip_code(digits)<br />  ZipCodeDigitFactory.new(digits).to_formatted_string<br />end</code></pre><br />Alas, space does not permit me to show you all of the subclasses of Digits he composed, one for each possible length of string. For example:<br /><pre><code><br />class FourZipCodeDigits < BaseZipCodeDigits<br />  def to_formatted_string<br />    "0#{self.to_s}"<br />  end<br />end</code></pre>I have also omitted his ZipCodeFactory that would take a normal string and figure out which particular subclass of BaseZipCodeDigits to construct.<br /><br />(I am told that a cathedral built by Purists is beautiful to behold, constructed lovingly of small bricks, no more than 50 lines per class, no more than 10 classes per package, no more than two instance variables per class, no more than one level of indentation per method, no more than one dot per line, and absolutely no else clauses.)<br /><br />Of course, the Librarian, Ascetic and the Purist hated each other with a passion fueled by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences">narcissism of small differences</a> into a raging fire of religious cleansing. Much politicking and fighting broke out over the code.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Agnostic carried on, quietly coding while the others bickered over how to properly rewrite what he would write. One day, he noticed that some unit tests were failing and raised the issue in Campfire.<br /><br /><strong>The Return of the Agnostic</strong><br /><br />&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;What happened to that piece of code? It was for zip codes, it was only supposed to pre-pend one or two zeros when importing zip codes from CSV files. Anything with fewer than three digits is supposed to be an invalid code. Empty strings shouldn&rsquo;t be converted to five zeros, as far as I know.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with that?&rdquo;<br /><br />The Librarian, Ascetic, and Purist were silent for a moment, and then immediately resumed arguing, this time over whether #rjust should have another parameter, whether the regular expression in a recursive routine should be changed, or whether the simplest thing was to simply change the method for the EmptyDigits, OneDigit, and TwoDigits classes.<br /><br />The Agnostic listened for a moment, tried to interject a few times, then sighed and reached for his text editor.<br /><br /><hr/><em>Update:</em> Reviewing the comments made elsewhere, I see that this post fell into the Fizzbuzz Trap: By quoting a programming problem&mdash;no matter how banal and contrived&mdash;the article was bound to provoke a huge amount of dicussion around the correct way to solve the problem, while ignoring the point of the post. This is my fault, I should have known better than to post a snippet of code. As many of you have noted, the post is not about the Agnostic or his code, it&rsquo;s about the dynamic of programmers eager to rewrite code in their own image, and the hypothesis that our (I am equally guilty of this behaviour) motivation for doing so is to emphasize the small differences between ourselves and others.<br /><br />For no matter how good or bad the Agnostic&rsquo;s code is, why did the Librarian rewrite the Ascetic&rsquo;s code? Why did the Purist rewrite it again? When they discovered that the Agnostic&rsquo;s code actually met some requirement, why weren&rsquo;t <em>they</em> talking about documentation, or the process around tests? Why were they all&mdash;including the agnostic&mdash;eager to rewrite it one more time?<br /><br />Seriously, the post is not about whether the Agnostic should have documented his code, or where the zip code validation should live. However, I should have known that the moment I included a piece of code to provide local colour, the resulting debate over its fitness was inevitable.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

However, they were not necessarily aware of the subtlety of the &ldquo;business rule&rdquo; that zip codes less than 00200 are invalid.<BR/><BR/>That being said, there <I>were</I> unit tests for the appropriate cases, and the programmers suggesting/making changes did not review all of the possible test before blindly making assumptions about what was going on.<BR/><BR/>In other words, they assumed that there was a bug rather than assuming that the desired behaviour was somewhat irregular.<br />

I started way back in the ascetic camp, then moved to purist view briefly before staying on the librarian side for a long time. I didn't become agnostic until I was the poor fool who had to stay up all night to find and fix the bugs. <BR/><BR/>It turns out that when you are really really sleepy your favorite pieces of code are always the most 'obvious' ones. Thinking is not fun in the middle of the night, and it shouldn't be necessary all of the time.<BR/><BR/>Not surprisingly, elegance comes from taking something 'hard' and finding the simplest, most obvious answer, thus making it look 'easy'.<BR/><BR/>Paul.<BR/><A HREF="http://theprogrammersparadox.blogspot.com" REL="nofollow">http://theprogrammersparadox.blogspot.com</A><br />

								<a name="8206193626300836899"></a> 				Joel Spolsky:<BR/><BR/><I>The idea that new code is better than old is patently absurd. Old code has been used. It has been tested. Lots of bugs have been found, and they've been fixed. There's nothing wrong with it. It doesn't acquire bugs just by sitting around on your hard drive. Au contraire, baby! Is software supposed to be like an old Dodge Dart, that rusts just sitting in the garage? Is software like a teddy bear that's kind of gross if it's not made out of all new material?<BR/><BR/>Back to that two page function. Yes, I know, it's just a simple function to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and nobody knows why. Well, I'll tell you why: those are bug fixes. One of them fixes that bug that Nancy had when she tried to install the thing on a computer that didn't have Internet Explorer. Another one fixes that bug that occurs in low memory conditions. Another one fixes that bug that occurred when the file is on a floppy disk and the user yanks out the disk in the middle. That LoadLibrary call is ugly but it makes the code work on old versions of Windows 95.<BR/><BR/>Each of these bugs took weeks of real-world usage before they were found. The programmer might have spent a couple of days reproducing the bug in the lab and fixing it. If it's like a lot of bugs, the fix might be one line of code, or it might even be a couple of characters, but a lot of work and time went into those two characters.<BR/><BR/>When you throw away code and start from scratch, you are throwing away all that knowledge. All those collected bug fixes. Years of programming work.</I><BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html" REL="nofollow">Things You Should Never Do, Part I</A><BR/><BR/>I think we can debate what Agnostic should have/could have done, but the real point of the story is that refactoring other people&rsquo;s code to suit your own religious convictions is difficult.<BR/><BR/>I am not going to say it cannot or should not be done, just pointing out how easy it is to break something in the zeal to make it &ldquo;better.&rdquo;<BR/><BR/>Joel continues:<BR/><BR/><I>problems can be solved, one at a time, by carefully moving code, refactoring, changing interfaces. They can be done by one programmer working carefully and checking in his changes all at once, so that nobody else is disrupted. Even fairly major architectural changes can be done without throwing away the code. On the Juno project we spent several months rearchitecting at one point: just moving things around, cleaning them up, creating base classes that made sense, and creating sharp interfaces between the modules. But we did it carefully, with our existing code base, and we didn't introduce new bugs or throw away working code.</I><BR/><BR/>I am not trying to give a black-and-white prescription here. Just pointing out how much the Ascetic, Librarian, and Purist have in common despite the fact that each of them thinks the other two are complete Bozos.<br />

Business rules change and code changes with them.<BR/><BR/>As for documenting the code, this is precisely why the Rails community has taken to calling unit tests 'specs.'<BR/><BR/>The argument for using specs in place of comments is that your build tool or cruise control will find violations, while future programmers who must bother to read your comments won't.<br />

The function name says that already.  "Formats a ZIP code by prepending one or two zeros to it if needed"?  That's exactly what the code says; there's no need to be redundant.<br />

								<a name="6543512942484057835"></a> 				Good points. I hate to see proceduralism in OO clothing.<BR/><BR/>In most popular languages however, formatting within a string <I>is</I> an example where ZipCode would exhibit polymorphic behaviour, e.g.<BR/><BR/>myZip = ZipCode.new('1234')<BR/>puts myZip.to_s<BR/><BR/>(My Ruby is rusty!) The to_s method is implemented polymorphically on ZipCode, Integer, Employee, etc., etc., and this polymorphism can be leveraged in general presentation and formatting routines.<BR/><BR/>Parsing from a string format is a similar case, so the validation example will be exercised polymorphically in many popular languages, too.<BR/><BR/>Enjoyed the article, by the way.<br />

								<a name="76053117538772024"></a> 				The problem with using unit tests as your specification is that you're splitting your specification from the code in a major way.  If there had been something, anything in the code that had pointed out that this is not only formating a number as a zip code, but performing incomplete validation on the number, this whole argument wouldn't have happened.  Instead, the answer is "You needed to read another file, in a different directory structure, to understand what this is really supposed to do."<BR/><BR/>The real problem is we shouldn't even be discussing the details of the problem, but rather whatever point ragenwald was trying to make.  Unfortunately, allegories are a tempting but useless communication vehicle, that deliberately obscures a point in hopes that it'll be more interesting (or harder to discuss).<br />

I'm definitely in the "Comments are code smells" camp here. <BR/><BR/>However, I like to kid myself that, if the tests were passing, I wouldn't have touched that code. While I'm kidding myself, I like to think that, if I had touched the code inanely, the tests would have told me about it pretty bloody sharpish and I'd've rolled back my changes and either gone to investigate, or moved onto something  productive.<BR/><BR/>As Reg says, we're in Allegoryland here, so spending any serious time on this particular code is silly, but I still say that we programmers should strive to write code so that, when we return to it a week later with our Ascetic/Librarian/Purist hats on, we're going to resist the urge to tamper because we've written code that attempts to express the why as well as the what.<br />

Or to talk to that programmer? Or to look at the context of the code to figure out what it does?<BR/><BR/>And furthermore that programmers are free to do this whenever they like, without reifying the change from X to Y as a bug or feature where the team can discuss it and prioritize it against other work?<BR/><BR/>Putting it in that light, do you not think that the other three programmers have some &rsquo;splaining to do?<BR/><BR/>I think that responsibility does not neatly add up to 100% in team contexts. While we can construct a course of action for any one person that might have avoided this allegorical problem, there is a much deeper dynamic at work that needs to be addressed.<BR/><BR/>Using comments or cruise control or reviewing every check-in to prevent programmers from rewriting code in their own image is ultimately a losing game of cops and robbers.<BR/><BR/>The way forward from my perspective is to address the dynamic that motivated the rewrites in the first  place.<BR/><BR/>The Ascetic, for example. We look at his code first, but even his thought that the code had to be wrong because it wasn&rsquo;t mathematically regular: Isn&rsquo;t that a strong reflection on his aesthetic desire rather than any objective fault in the Agnostic&rsquo;s code?<br />

A pragmatist believes that what he is doing is the best way.<BR/><BR/>There is a marked difference between the two, and I deliberately chose to label him an agnostic to hint that he doesn't necessarily believe the ascetic, librarian, and purist are wrong.<BR/><BR/>Where a self-identified pragmatist would argue with them that his code was better because it was pragmatic, the agnostic acknowledges that there are times when his approach is not the best way.<br />

								<a name="5782343882392501721"></a> 				What's interesting to me is that every time an anecdote is given, and the author gives out titles like 'pragmatist', or 'purist', then there is automatically a bias in peoples minds drawing from the connotations of the word used.  As a result, no commentor would ever label themselves a purist, for example.<BR/><BR/>But in actual fact we're all of these at different times and, I've found, we may be a purist to one person and a pragmatist to another.  <BR/><BR/>End of the day, we are paid to write code and provide value to business, and business don't care either way.<BR/><BR/>But I will say there's been very few pieces of code I've looked at that hasn't made my fingers itch.... perhaps it has less to do with trying to empahsis differences and more to do with placing our mark of craftmanship on what we've worked on?<BR/><BR/>Great article.<br />

One of the things that always astounds me in the Christian church is how the closer two people are in theological understanding, the more likely they are to consider the other a complete idiot.  As a corollary, the incidence of "One True Way"-style talk is inversely related to the diversity of the group.<BR/><BR/>I have no idea why this is true, but I suspect it relates to the incredible annoyance of a musical instrument being a half step out of tune.<BR/><BR/>This weird behavior happens in development environments, too: people who all appreciate the same goal in development (writing productive code) can really get hung up over some silly stuff.<BR/><BR/>(BTW, clearly the first programmer needed to define a type of "ZipDigits" which prevented the wrong number of digits from compiling in the first place.)<br />

								<a name="7669164745370776329"></a> 				@james --<BR/><BR/>actually, treating "int"-iness does appear to be the only valid use of such a constraint, but as a programmer it's not always in your power to reformat every instance of old data you're required to pull in. so this is a perfectly normal function to find in use on the data layer. it correctly handles everything from "999"-"99999-9999", including foreign post codes. my "one-liner" earlier was mistaken, as it mangles zip+4's and foreign postal codes, despite being called "digits"... my function shouldda been more like:<BR/><BR/>(2 < digits.size < 5) && "00#{digits}"[-5] || digits<BR/><BR/>that's exactly the same functionally (assuming it's valid ruby or w/e), but still gives you a reason to argue points for style.<BR/><BR/>i think that's the intent of the original article. ignore the possible repercussions of changing the function result a bit.<BR/><BR/>"However, I should have known that the moment I included a piece of code to provide local colour, the resulting debate over its fitness was inevitable."<br />

I posted an article about purism vs. pragmatism at the following link: <a href="http://www.softwarepurist.com/blog/index.php/purism-vs-pragmatism/" rel="nofollow">http://www.softwarepurist.com/blog/index.php/purism-vs-pragmatism/</a>.  Overall, your post is sort of humorous and it is amusing how that thing can happen.  Good read.<br />

And not about dumbing down code.&rdquo; Although the examples he gives are nothing like the examples that crossed my mind.<br /><br />I have been happiest when I have worked with people much, much smarter than I am, people who forced me to raise my game. I recall that when I worked on JProbe Threadalyzer, the three key people on my team were Steve Rosenberg, Christian Jaekl, and John MacMillan. Steve was my manager, and he forced me to raise my game as a team lead. Christian was our domain expert, he had written his Masters Thesis on analyzing the behaviour of concurrent software, and he forced me to immerse myself deeply in concurrency just to understand what he was designing. And John was a C++ Wizard. I recall him being extremely patient with me a I got up to speed writing production C++ code.<br /><br />All three were patient with my shortcomings, but our culture was to help me be more productive, to help me understand their ideas. Not to hold them back so that I could stay in my comfort zone.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

								<a name="1070962265538665303"></a> 				(allow me to skip the whole libertarianism debate :) )<BR/>I believe complexity is there, either implicitly, covered by a high level language/framework/design, or explicitly in lines and lines of "dumbed down" code. By dumbing down the steps needed to solve a problem, we're not making the problem easier, just worsening the solution (and paradoxically, making it more complex) . If you need to dumb down the code because somebody else can barely understand the solution, chances are that when that person does a modification will break something anyway. But there's a fine line between "this is a better solution" and "this is my solution, if you don't understand it, is your problem,... don't ask me to degrade it", I don't develop code in isolation, and I try to run my "clever" solutions by another member in the team so I'm sure it can be understood.<BR/>(coincidence... my last blog entry was about <A HREF="http://gabrielsw.blogspot.com/2008/05/questions-only-questions.html" REL="nofollow">the same questions</A><br />

								<a name="5950446010713255846"></a> 				This is a total tangent, but I'm always fascinated by the fact that an Ayn Rand reference, in any context, on any topic, will invariably draw out a few people who want to make sure you understand that Rand was wrong, wrong, <B>wrong</B>.  And usually something about how she was an awful person in real life, to boot.  Followed, usually, by a cadre of people defending her,  also ignoring the original topic.<BR/><BR/>I once had an uncle ask me what I was reading, and upon showing him the cover, he instantly launched into a heated tirade about how wrong and stupid Rand was.<BR/><BR/>I know of no other author who inspires this level of reflexive reaction.<BR/><BR/>(Also, just to toss some more mud into the waters, Rand was very vocal in her disdain for libertarians.)<BR/><BR/>(Meta-meta comment: Google's OpenID support appears to be broken; my first attempt to post this wound up at some "duplicate action" error page.)<br />

Someone asked, "What's the deal with [currying and partial application](https://raganwald.com/2013/03/07/currying-and-partial-application.html)? Why can't we be satisfied with functions that take multiple parameters?" Answering that question led to this one:

### what is functional programming?

And I answer, functional programming is some mix of one, two, or all three of:

1. Programming based on the mathematics of functions. The primary of characteristic of "mathematics-oriented" functional programming is referential transparency.
2. Programming where everything is a value. The oft-quoted primary characteristic of "value-oriented" functional programming is first-class functions.
3. Programming based on composition (and decomposition. and recomposition). The primary characteristic of "composition-oriented" functional programming is point-free style.

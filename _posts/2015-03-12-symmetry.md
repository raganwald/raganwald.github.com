In JavaScript, functions are *first-class entities*: You can store them in data structures, pass them to other functions, and return them from functions. An amazing number of very strong programming techniques arise as a consequence of functions-as-first-class-entities. One of the strongest is also one of the simplest: You can write functions that compose and transform other functions.

### a very, very, very basic introduction to decorators

Let's consider logical negation. We might have a function like this:

```javascript
const isaFruit = (f) =>
  f === 'apple' || f === 'banana' || f === 'orange';

isaFruit('orange')
  //=> true
```

We can use it to pick fruit from a basket, using an array's `.filter` method:

```javascript
['pecan',
 'apple',
 'chocolate',
 'cracker',
 'orange'].filter(isaFruit)
  //=> ["apple","orange"]
```

What if we want the things-that-are-not-fruit? There are a few solutions. Languages like Smalltalk and Ruby have a style where collections provide a `.reject` method. Or we could write a `notaFruit` function:

```javascript
const notaFruit = (f) =>
  f !== 'apple' && f !== 'banana' && f !== 'orange';

['pecan',
 'apple',
 'chocolate',
 'cracker',
 'orange'].filter(notaFruit)
  //=> ["pecan","chocolate","cracker"]
```

We could also take advantage of function expressions and inline the logical negation of `isaFruit`:

```javascript
['pecan',
 'apple',
 'chocolate',
 'cracker',
 'orange'].filter(it => !isaFruit(it));
  //=> ["pecan","chocolate","cracker"]
```

That is interesting. It's a pattern we can repeat to find things in the basket that don't start with "c:"

```javascript
const startsWithC = (f) =>
  f[0] === 'c' || f[0] === 'C';

['pecan',
 'apple',
 'chocolate',
 'cracker',
 'orange'].filter(it => !startsWithC(it))
  //=> ["pecan","apple","orange"]
```

We can take advantage of functions-as-first-class-entities to turn this pattern into a function that modifies another function. We can use that to name another function, or even use it inline as an expression:

```javascript
const not = (fn) =>
  (...args) =>
    !(fn(...args))

const anotherNotaFruit = not(isaFruit);

anotherNotaFruit("pecan")
  //=> true

['pecan',
 'apple',
 'chocolate',
 'cracker',
 'orange'].filter(not(startsWithC))
  //=> ["pecan","apple","orange"]
```

`not` is a *decorator*, a function that takes another function and "decorates it" with new functionality that is semantically related to the original function's behaviour. This allows us to use `not(isaFruit)` anywhere we could use `isaFuit`, or use `not(startsWithC)` anywhere we can use `startsWithC`.

`not` is so trivial that it doesn't feel like it wins us much, but the exact same principle allows us to write decorators like `maybe`:

```javascript
const maybe = (fn) =>
  (...args) => {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return arg;
    }
    return fn(...args);
  }

[1, null, 3, 4, null, 6, 7].map(maybe(x => x * x))
  //=> [1,null,9,16,null,36,49]
```

And to make combinators like `compose`:

```javascript
const compose = (fn, ...rest) =>
  rest.length === 0
  ? fn
  : (arg) => fn(compose(...rest)(arg));

compose(x => x + 1, y => y * y)(10)
  //=> 101
```

You'll find lots of other decorators and combinators [swanning about] in [books about using functions in JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix "Shameless plug for the author's book"). And your favourite JavaScript library is probably loaded with decorators that memoize the result of an idempotent function, or debounce functions that you may use to call a server from a browser.

### what makes decorators and combinators easy

The power arising from functions-as-first-class-entities is that we have a very flexible way to make functions out of functions, using functions. We are not "multiplying our entities unnecessarily." On the surface, decorators and combinators are made possible by the fact that we can pass functions to functions, and return functions that invoke our original functions.

But there's something else: The fact that all functions are called in the exact same way. We write `foo(bar)` and know that we will evaluate `bar`, and pass the resulting value to the function we get by evaluating `foo`. This allows us to write decorators and combinators that work with any function.

Or does it?

### what would make decorators and combinators difficult

Imagine, if you will, that functions came in two colours: <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, and <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span>. Now imagine that when we invoke a function in a variable, we type the name of the function in the proper colour. So if we write <fixed><span style="color: blue;">const square = (x) => x * x</span></fixed>, we also have to write <fixed><span style="color: blue;">square(5)</span></fixed>, so that `square` is always <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>.

If we write <fixed><span style="color: blue;">const square = (x) => x * x</span></fixed>, but elsewhere we write <fixed><span style="color: #999900;">square(5)</span></fixed>, it won't work because `square` is a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> function and `square(5)` would be a <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span> invocation.

If functions worked like that, decorators would be very messy. We'd have to make colour-coded decorators, like a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> `maybe` and a <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span> `maybe`. We'd have to carefully track which functions have which colours, much as in gendered languages like French, you need to know the gender of all inanimate objects so that you can use the correct gendered grammar when talking about them.

This sounds bad, and for programming tools, it is.[^french] The general principle is: *Have fewer kinds of similar things, but allow the things you do have to combine in flexible ways*. You can't just remove things, you have to also make it very easy to combine things. Functions as first-class-entities are a good example of this, because they allow you to combine functions in flexible ways.

Coloured functions would be an example of how not to do it, because you'd be making it harder to combine functions by balkanizing them.[^colours]

[^colours]: Bob Nystrom introduced this excellent metaphor in [What colour is your function?](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/)

[^french]: Bad for programming languages, of course. French is a lovely human language.

Functions don't have colours in JavaScript. But there are things that have this kind of asymmetry that make things just as awkward. For example, methods in JavaScript are functions. But, when you invoke them, you have to get `this` set up correctly. You have to either:

1. Invoke a method as a property of an object. e.g. `foo.bar(baz)` or `foo['bar'](baz)`.
2. Bind an object to a method before invoking it, e.g. `bar.bind(foo)`.
3. Invoke the method with with `.call` or `.apply`, e.g `bar.call(foo, baz)`.

Thus, we can imagine that calling a function directly (e.g. `bar(baz)`) is <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, invoking a function and setting `this` (e.g. `bar.call(foo, baz)`) is <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span>.

Or in other words, functions are <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, and methods are <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span>.

### the composability problem

We often write decorators in <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, a/k/a pure functional style. Here's a decorator that makes a function throw an exception if its argument is not a finite number:

```javascript
const requiresFinite = (fn) =>
  (n) => {
    if (Number.isFinite(n)){
      return fn(n);
    }
    else throw "Bad Wolf";
  }

const plusOne = x => x + 1;

plusOne(1)
  //=> 2

plusOne([])
  //=> 1 WTF!?

const safePlusOne = requiresFinite(plusOne);

safePlusOne(1)
  //=> 2

safePlusOne([])
  //=> throws "Bad Wolf"
```

But it won't work on methods. Here's a `Circle` class that has an unsafe `.scaleBy` method:

```javascript
class Circle {
  constructor (radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }
  circumference () {
    return Math.PI * 2 * this.radius;
  }
  scaleBy (factor) {
    return new Circle(factor * this.radius);
  }
}

const two = new Circle(2);

two.scaleBy(3).circumference()
  //=> 37.69911184307752

two.scaleBy(null).circumference()
  //=> 0 WTF!?
```

Let's decorate the `scaleBy` method to check its argument:

```javascript
Circle.prototype.scaleBy = requiresFinite(Circle.prototype.scaleBy);

two.scaleBy(null).circumference()
  //=> throws "Bad Wolf"
```

Looks good, let's put it into production:

```javascript
Circle.prototype.scaleBy = requiresFinite(Circle.prototype.scaleBy);

two.scaleBy(3).circumference()
  //=> undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.radius')
```

Whoops, we forgot that method invocation is <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span> code, so our <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> `requiresFinite` decorator will not work on methods. This is the problem of <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span> and <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> code colliding.

### composing functions with green code

Fortunately, we can write higher-order functions like decorators and combinators in a style that works for both "pure" functions and for methods. We have to use the `function` keyword so that `this` is bound, and then invoke our decorated function using `.call` so that we can pass `this` along.

Here's `requiresFinite` written in this style, which we will call <span style="color: green;"> green </span>. It works for decorating both methods *and* functions:

```javascript
const requiresFinite = (fn) =>
  function (n) {
    if (Number.isFinite(n)){
      return fn.call(this, n);
    }
    else throw "Bad Wolf";
  }

Circle.prototype.scaleBy = requiresFinite(Circle.prototype.scaleBy);

two.scaleBy(3).circumference()
  //=> 37.69911184307752

two.scaleBy("three").circumference()
  //=> throws "Bad Wolf"

const safePlusOne = requiresFinite(x => x + 1);

safePlusOne(1)
  //=> 2

safePlusOne([])
  //=> throws "Bad Wolf"
```

We can write all of our decorators and combinators in <span style="color: green;"> green </span> style. For example, instead of writing `maybe` in functional (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>) style like this:

```javascript
const maybe = (fn) =>
  (...args) => {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return arg;
    }
    return fn(...args);
  }
```

We can write it in both functional and method style (<span style="color: green;"> green </span>) style like this:

```javascript
const maybe = (method) =>
  function (...args) {
    for (let arg of args) {
      if (arg == null) return arg;
    }
    return method.apply(this, args);
  }
```

And instead of writing our simple compose in functional (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>) style like this:

```javascript
const compose = (a, b) =>
  (x) => a(b(x));
```

We can write it in both functional and method style (<span style="color: green;"> green </span>) style like this:

```javascript
const compose = (a, b) =>
  function (x) {
    return a.call(this, b.call(this, x));
  }
```

What makes JavaScript tolerable is that <span style="color: green;"> green </span> handling works for both  functional (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>) and method invocation (<span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span>) code. But when writing large code bases, we have to remain aware that some functions are <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> and some are <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span>, because if we write a mostly <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> program, we could be lured into complacency with with <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> decorators and combinators for years. But everything would break if a <span style="color: #999900;">khaki</span> method was introduced that didn't play nicely with our <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> combinators

The safe thing to do is to write all our higher-order functions in <span style="color: green;"> green </span> style, so that they work for functions or methods. And that's why we might talk about the simpler, <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> form when introducing an idea, but we write out the more complete, <span style="color: green;"> green </span> form when implementing it as a recipe.

### red functions vs. object factories

JavaScript classes (and the equivalent prototype-based patterns) rely on creating objects with the `new` keyword. As we saw in the example above:

```javascript
class Circle {
  constructor (radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }
  circumference () {
    return Math.PI * 2 * this.radius;
  }
  scaleBy (factor) {
    return new Circle(factor * this.radius);
  }
}

const round = new Circle(1);

round.circumference()
  //=> 6.2831853
```

That `new` keyword introduces yet *another* colour of function, constructors are <span style="color: red;"> red </span> functions. We can't make circles using <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> function calls:

```javascript
const round2 = Circle(2);
  //=> Cannot call a class as a function

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(Circle)
  //=> Cannot call a class as a function
```

And we certainly can't use a decorator on them:

```javascript
const CircleRequiringFiniteRadius = requiresFinite(Circle);

const round3 = new CircleRequiringFiniteRadius(3);
  //=> Cannot call a class as a function
```

Some experienced developers dislike `new` because of this problem: It introduces one more kind of function that doesn't compose neatly with other functions using our existing decorators and combinators.

We could eliminate <span style="color: red;"> red </span> functions by using prototypes and `Object.create` instead of using the `class` and `new` keywords. A "factory function" is a function that makes new objects. So instead of writing a `Circle` class, we would write a `CirclePrototype` and a `CircleFactory` function:

```javascript
const CirclePrototype = {
  circumference () {
    return Math.PI * 2 * this.radius;
  },
  scaleBy (factor) {
    return CircleFactory(factor * this.radius);
  }
};

const CircleFactory = (radius) =>
  Object.create(CirclePrototype, {
    radius: { value: radius, enumerable: true }
  })

CircleFactory(2).scaleBy(3).circumference()
  //=> 37.69911184307752
```

Now we have a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> `CircleFactory` function, and we have the benefits of objects and methods, along with the benefits of decorating and composing factories like any other function. For example:

```javascript
const requiresFinite = (fn) =>
  function (n) {
    if (Number.isFinite(n)){
      return fn.call(this, n);
    }
    else throw "Bad Wolf";
  }

const FiniteCircleFactory = requiresFinite(CircleFactory);

FiniteCircleFactory(2).scaleBy(3).circumference()
  //=> 37.69911184307752

FiniteCircleFactory(null).scaleBy(3).circumference()
  //=> throws "Bad Wolf"
```

All that being said, programming with factory functions instead of with classes and `new` is not a cure-all. Besides losing some of the convenience and familiarity for other developers, we'd also have to use extreme discipline for fear that accidentally introducing some <span style="color: red;"> red </span> classes would break our carefully crafted "blue in green" application.

In the end, there's no avoiding the need to know which functions are functions, and which are actually classes. Tooling can help: Some linting applications can enforce a naming convention where classes start with an upper-case letter and functions start with a lower-case letter.

### charmed functions

Consider:

```javascript
const likesToDrink = (whom) => {
  switch (whom) {
    case 'Bob':
      return 'Ristretto';
    case 'Carol':
      return 'Cappuccino';
    case 'Ted':
      return 'Allongé';
    case 'Alice':
      return 'Cappuccino';
  }
}

likesToDrink('Alice')
  //=> 'Cappuccino'

likesToDrink('Peter')
  //=> undefined;
```

That's a pretty straightforward function that implements a mapping from `Bob`, `Carol`, `Ted`, and `Alice` to the drinks 'Ristretto', 'Cappuccino', and 'Allongé'. The mapping is encoded implicitly in the code's `switch` statement.

We can use it in combination with other functions. For example, we can find out if the first letter of what someone likes is "c:"

```javascript
const startsWithC = (something) => !!something.match(/^c/i)

startsWithC(likesToDrink('Alice'))
  //=> true

const likesSomethingStartingWithC =
  compose(startsWithC, likesToDrink);

likesSomethingStartingWithC('Ted')
  //=> false
```

So far, that's good, clean <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> function work. But there's yet another kind of "function call." If you are a mathematician, this is a mapping too:

```javascript
const personToDrink = {
  Bob: 'Ristretto',
  Carol: 'Cappuccino',
  Ted: 'Allongé',
  Alice: 'Cappuccino'
}

personToDrink['Alice']
  //=> 'Cappuccino'

personToDrink['Ted']
  //=> 'Allongé'
```

`personToDrink` also maps the names 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Ted', and 'Alice' to the drinks 'Ristretto', 'Cappuccino', and 'Allongé', just like `likesToDrink`. But even though it does the same thing as a function, we can't use it as a function:

```javascript
const personMapsToSomethingStartingWithC =
  compose(startsWithC, personToDrink);

personMapsToSomethingStartingWithC('Ted')
  //=> undefined is not a function (evaluating 'b.call(this, x)')
```

As you can see, `[` and `]` are a little like `(` and `)`, because we can pass `Alice` to `personToDrink` and get back `Cappuccino`. But they are just different enough, that we can't write `personToDrink(...)`. Objects (as well as ES-6 maps and sets) are "charmed functions."

And you need a different piece of code to go with them. We'd need to write things like this:

```javascript
const composeblueWithCharm =
  (bluefunction, charmedfunction) =>
    (arg) =>
      bluefunction(charmedfunction[arg]);

const composeCharmWithblue =
  (charmedfunction, bluefunction) =>
    (arg) =>
      charmedfunction[bluefunction(arg)]

// ...
```

That would get really old, really fast.

### adapting to handle red and charmed functions

We can work our way around some of these cross-colour and charm issues by writing *adaptors*, wrappers that turn <span style="color: red;"> red </span> and charmed functions into <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> functions. As we saw above, a "factory function" is a function that is called in the normal way, and returns a freshly created object.

If we wanted to create a `CircleFactory`, we could use `Object.create` as we saw above. We could also wrap `new Circle(...)` in a function:

```javascript
class Circle {
  constructor (radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }
  circumference () {
    return Math.PI * 2 * this.radius;
  }
  scaleBy (factor) {
    return new Circle(factor * this.radius);
  }
}

const CircleFactory = (radius) =>
  new Circle(radius);

CircleFactory(2).scaleBy(3).circumference()
  //=> 37.69911184307752
```

With some argument jiggery-pokery, we could abstract `Circle` from `CircleFactory` and make a factory for making factories, a `FactoryFactory`:

We would write a `CircleFactory` function:

```javascript
const FactoryFactory = (clazz) =>
  (...args) =>
    new clazz(...args);

const CircleFactory = FactoryFactory(Circle);

circleFactory(5).circumference()
  //=> 31.4159265
```

`FactoryFactory` turns any <span style="color: red;"> red </span> class into a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> function. So we can use it any where we like:

```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(FactoryFactory(Circle))
  //=>
    [{"radius":1},{"radius":2},{"radius":3},{"radius":4},{"radius":5}]
```

Sadly, we still have to remember that `Circle` is a class and be sure to wrap it in `FactoryFactory` when we need to use it as a function, but that does work.

We can do a similar thing with our "charmed" maps (and arrays, for that matter). Here's `Dictionary`, a function that turns objects and arrays (our "charmed" functions) into ordinary (<span style="color: blue;">blue</span>) functions:

```javascript
const Dictionary = (data) => (key) => data[key];

const personToDrink = {
  Bob: 'Ristretto',
  Carol: 'Cappuccino',
  Ted: 'Allongé',
  Alice: 'Cappuccino'
}

['Bob', 'Ted', 'Carol', 'Alice'].map(Dictionary(personToDrink))
  //=> ["Ristretto","Allongé","Cappuccino","Cappuccino"]
```

`Dictionary` makes it easier for us to use all of the same tools for combining and manipulating functions on arrays and objects that we do with functions.

### dictionaries as proxies

As [David Nolen](http://swannodette.github.io) has pointed out, languages like Clojure have maps that can be called as functions automatically. This is superior to wrapping a map in a plain function, because the underlying map is still available to be iterated over and otherwise treated as a map. Once we wrap a map in a function, it becomes opaque, useless for anything except calling as a function.

If we wish, we can create a dictionary function that is a partial proxy for the underlying collection object. For example, here is an `IterableDictionary` that turns a collection into a function that is also iterable if its underlying data object is iterable:

```javascript
const IterableDictionary = (data) => {
  const proxy = (key) => data[key];
  proxy[Symbol.iterator] = function* (...args) {
    yield* data[Symbol.iterator](...args);
  }
  return proxy;
}

const people = IterableDictionary(['Bob', 'Ted', 'Carol', 'Alice']);
const drinks = IterableDictionary(personToDrink);

for (let name of people) {
  console.log(`${name} prefers to drink ${drinks(name)}`)
}
  //=>
    Bob prefers to drink Ristretto
    Ted prefers to drink Allongé
    Carol prefers to drink Cappuccino
    Alice prefers to drink Cappuccino
```

This technique has limitations. For example, objects in JavaScript are not iterable by default. So we can't write:

```javascript
for (let [name, drink] of personToDrink) {
  console.log(`${name} prefers to drink ${drink}`)
}
  //=> undefined is not a function (evaluating 'personToDrink[Symbol.iterator]()')
```

We could write:

```javascript
for (let [name, drink] of Object.entries(personToDrink)) {
  console.log(`${name} prefers to drink ${drink}`)
}
  //=>
    Bob prefers to drink Ristretto
    Carol prefers to drink Cappuccino
    Ted prefers to drink Allongé
    Alice prefers to drink Cappuccino
```

It would be an enormous hack to make `Object.entries(IterableDictionary(personToDrink))` work. While we're at it, how would we make `.length` work? Functions implement `.length` as the number of arguments they accept. Arrays implement it as the number of entries they hold. If we wrap an array in a dictionary, what is its `.length`?

Proxying collections, meaning "creating an object that behaves like the collection," works for specific and limited contexts, but it is enormously fragile to attempt to make a universal proxy that also acts as a function.

### summary

JavaScript's elegance comes from having a simple thing, functions, that can be combined in many flexible ways. Exceptions to the ways functions combine, like the `new` keyword, handling `this`, and `[...]`, make combining awkward, but we can work around that by writing adaptors to convert these exceptions to regular function calls.

p.s. For bonus credit, write adaptors for EcmaScript's `Map` and `Set` collections.

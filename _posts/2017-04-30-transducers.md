In [Using iterators to write highly composeable code][previous-post], we saw that the [staged approach] to data transformation is decomposed, but duplicates the entire data set. Whereas, the [single pass approach]  is more efficient, but the code was entangled and monolithic.

[previous-post]: https://raganwald.com/2017/04/19/incremental.html
[staged approach]: https://raganwald.com/2017/04/19/incremental.html#I
[single pass approach]: https://raganwald.com/2017/04/19/incremental.html#II

Now we're going to look at an interesting approach for building composeable pipelines of transformations without incurring a memory penalty, **transducers**.

Let's start with a review of reducing (a/k/a "folding"):

---

### reducers

A **reducer** is a function that takes an accumulation and a value, and folds the value into the accumulation. For example, if `[1, 2, 3]` is an accumulation ,and `4` is a value, `(acc, val) => acc.concat([val]);` is a reducer that returns `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:

```javascript
const acc = [1, 2, 3];
const val = 4;
const reducer = (acc, val) => acc.concat([val]);

reducer(acc, val)
  ///=> 1, 2, 3, 4
```

`(acc, val) => acc.concat([val])` is a reducer that returns the *catenation* of a list and a value.

Likewise, `(acc, val) => acc.add(val)` is a reducer that `.add`s a value to an accumulation. It works for any object that has a `.add` method and returns itself from `.add`, like [Set.prototype.add]:

```javascript
const acc = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const val = 4;
const reducer = (acc, val) => acc.add(val);

reducer(acc, val)
  ///=> Set{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

[Set.prototype.add]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/add

Here is a function that makes an array out of any iterable using our catenation reducer:

```javascript
const toArray = iterable => {
  const reducer = (acc, val) => acc.concat([val]);
  const seed = [];
  let accumulation = seed;

  for (value of iterable) {
    accumulation = reducer(accumulation, value);
  }

  return accumulation;
}

toArray([1, 2, 3])
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
```

We can extract our `reducer` and `seed` variables as parameters to create a *reduction* function:

```javascript
const reduce = (iterable, reducer, seed) => {
  let accumulation = seed;

  for (const value of iterable) {
    accumulation = reducer(accumulation, value);
  }

  return accumulation;
}

reduce([1, 2, 3], (acc, val) => acc.concat([val]), [])
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
```

Thankfully, JavaScript is evolving towards a convention of writing functions like `reduce` to take the reducer first. In [JavaScript AllongÃ©][ja]-style nomenclature, we can write:

[ja]: https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix

```javascript
const reduceWith = (reducer, seed, iterable) => {
  let accumulation = seed;

  for (const value of iterable) {
    accumulation = reducer(accumulation, value);
  }

  return accumulation;
}

reduce((acc, val) => acc.concat([val]), [], [1, 2, 3])
  //=> [1, 2, 3]

// becomes:

reduceWith((acc, val) => acc.concat([val]), [], [1, 2, 3])
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
```
In JavaScript, arrays have a `.reduce` method built in, and they behave exactly like our `reduce` or `reduceWith` functions:

```javascript
[1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, val) => acc.concat([val]), [])
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
```

Now, `(acc, val) => acc.concat([val])` makes a lot of excess copies of things, and in JavaScript, we can substitute `(acc, val) => { acc.push(val); return acc; }`.[^comma]

[^comma]: `(acc, val) => (acc.push(val), acc)` is more pleasing semantically, but the comma operator is confusing to those who haven't seen its regular use, and usually best avoided in production code.

Either way, what we get is a reducer that accumulates values into an array. Let's give it a name:

```javascript
const arrayOf = (acc, val) => { acc.push(val); return acc; };

reduceWith(arrayOf, [], [1, 2, 3])
  //=> [1, 2, 3]
```

Here's yet another reducer:

```javascript
const sumOf = (acc, val) => acc + val;

reduceWith(sumOf, 0, [1, 2, 3])
  //=> 6
```

We can write reducers that reduce an iterable of one type (such as an array) into another type (such as a number).

---

### decorating reducers

JavaScript makes it easy to write functions that return functions. Here's a function that makes a reducer for us:

```javascript
const joinedWith =
  separator =>
    (acc, val) =>
      acc == '' ? val : `${acc}${separator}${val}`;

reduceWith(joinedWith(', '), '', [1, 2, 3])
  //=> "1, 2, 3"

reduceWith(joinedWith('.'), '', [1, 2, 3])
  //=> "1.2.3"
```

JavaScript also makes it easy to write functions that take functions as arguments.

*Decorators* are JavaScript functions that take a function as an argument and return another function that is semantically related to its argument. For example, this function takes a binary function and decorates it by adding one to its second input:

```javascript
const incrementSecondArgument =
  binaryFn =>
    (x, y) => binaryFn(x, y + 1);

const power =
  (base, exponent) => base ** exponent;

const higherPower = incrementSecondArgument(power);

power(2, 3)
  //=> 8

higherPower(2, 3)
  //=> 16
```

`higherPower` is `power`, decorated to add one to its `exponent`. Thus, `higherPower(2, 3)` produces the same result as `power(2, 4)`. We have been working with binary functions already, of course. Reducers are binary functions. Can we decorate them? Yes!

```javascript
reduceWith(incrementSecondArgument(arrayOf), [], [1, 2, 3])
  //=> [2, 3, 4]

const incremented =
  iterable =>
    reduceWith(incrementSecondArgument(arrayOf), [], iterable);

incremented([1, 2, 3])
  //=> [2, 3, 4]
```

---

### mappers

We have produced a *mapper*, a function that takes an iterable and returns a mapping from the iterable's values to the incremented iterable's values. We map values all the time in JavaScript, but of course we want to do more than just increment. Let's take another look at `incrementSecondArgument`:

```javascript
const incrementSecondArgument =
  binaryFn =>
    (x, y) => binaryFn(x, y + 1);
```

Since we're using it to decorate reducers, let's give it some more relevant names:

```javascript
const incrementValue =
  reducer =>
    (acc, val) => reducer(acc, val + 1);
```

Now we see at a glance that `incrementValue` takes a reducer as an argument and returns a reducer that increments its value before reducing it further. We can extract the "incrementing" logic into a parameter:

```javascript
const map =
  fn =>
    reducer =>
      (acc, val) => reducer(acc, fn(val));

const incrementValue = map(x => x + 1);

reduceWith(incrementValue(arrayOf), [], [1, 2, 3])
  //=> [2, 3, 4]
```

Although it looks unfamiliar to people not used to the idea of a function taking a function as an argument and returning a function that takes a function as an argument, we can write `map(x => x + 1)` anywhere we can write `incrementValue`, therefore we can write:

```javascript
reduceWith(map(x => x + 1)(arrayOf), [], [1, 2, 3])
  //=> [2, 3, 4]
```

And because our `map` decorator can decorate any reducer, we can also join the increments of the numbers from one to three into a  string or sum them:

```javascript
reduceWith(map(x => x + 1)(joinedWith('.')), '', [1, 2, 3])
  //=> "2.3.4"

reduceWith(map(x => x + 1)(sumOf), 0, [1, 2, 3])
  //=> 9
```

Armed with all we've seen so far, what is the sum of the squares of the numbers from one to ten?

```javascript
const squares = map(x => power(x, 2));
const one2ten = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

reduceWith(squares(sumOf), 0, one2ten)
  //=> 385
```

### filters

Let's go back to our first reducer:

```javascript
const arrayOf = (acc, val) => { acc.push(val); return acc; };

reduceWith(arrayOf, [], one2ten)
  //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

What if we want an array of just the numbers greater than five? Easily done:

```javascript
const bigUns = (acc, val) => {
  if (val > 5 ) {
    acc.push(val);
  }
  return acc;
};

reduceWith(bigUns, [], one2ten)
  //=> [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Naturally, we can combine what we already have to produce an array of the squares of the numbers greater than five:

```javascript
reduceWith(squares(bigUns), [], one2ten)
  //=> [9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

This is not what we wanted! We have the *squares* that are greater than five, rather than the squares of the numbers that are greater than five. We want to do the selecting of numbers before we do the squaring, not after. This is easily done, and the insight is that what we want is a decorator that selects numbers, and we can use that to decorate the reducer:

```javascript
reduceWith(squares(arrayOf), [], one2ten)
  //=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

const bigUnsOf =
  reducer =>
    (acc, val) =>
      (val > 5) ? reducer(acc, val) : acc;

reduceWith(bigUnsOf(squares(arrayOf)), [], one2ten)
  //=> [36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

`bgUnsOf` is rather specific. Just as we did with `map`, let's extract the predicate function:

```javascript
reduceWith(squares(arrayOf), [], one2ten)
  //=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

const filter =
  fn =>
    reducer =>
      (acc, val) =>
        fn(val) ? reducer(acc, val) : acc;

reduceWith(filter(x => x > 5)(squares(arrayOf)), [], one2ten)
  //=> [36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

We can make all kinds of filters, and name them if we want. Or not:

```javascript
reduceWith(filter(x => x % 2 === 1)(arrayOf), [], one2ten)
  //=> [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

With all this in hand, the sum of the squares of the odd numbers from one to ten is:

```javascript
reduceWith(filter(x => x % 2 === 1)(squares(sumOf)), 0, one2ten)
  //=> 165
```

---

### "transformers" and composition

Denizens of other programming communities have a word for a function that takes an argument and transforms it into something else: They call such functions "transformers." What we call decorators are a special case of transformers, and so if some talks about a "transformer" function that transforms a reducer into another reducer, we know that they are talking about the same thing as when we talk about a function that "decorates" a reducer with some additional functionality such as mapping or filtering.

The mappers and filters we have discussed so far are transformers. Within the context of this programming pattern, an essential characteristic of transformers is that they *compose* to produce a new transformer. As a refresher, here's a function that composes any two functions:

```javascript
const plusFive = x => x + 5;
const divideByTwo = x => x / 2;

plusFive(3)
  //=> 8

divideByTwo(8)
  //=> 4

const compose2 =
  (a, b) =>
    (...c) =>
      a(b(...c));

const plusFiveDividedByTwo = compose2(divideByTwo, plusFive);

plusFiveDividedByTwo(3)
  //=> 4
```

What does it mean to say that transformers compose to make a new transformer? Just that if we `compose2` any two transformers, we get a new transformer that transforms a reducer. Thus:

```javascript
const squaresOfTheOddNumbers = compose2(
  filter(x => x % 2 === 1),
  squares
);

reduceWith(squaresOfTheOddNumbers(sumOf), 0, one2ten)
  //=> 165
```

`squaresOfTheOddNumbers` is a transformer we created by composing a filter with a mapper.

Being able to compose decorators lets us decompose complex and highly coupled code into smaller units with a single responsibility that we can name if we choose.

---

### composition with transformers

Now that we know how to `compose2`, what if we want to compose an arbitrary number of functions? There's a reduction for that!

let's start by rewriting `compose2` as a transformer, `compositionOf`:

```javascript
const compositionOf = (acc, val) => (...args) => val(acc(...args));
```

Now we can write `compose` as a reduction of its arguments:

```javascript
const compose = (...fns) =>
  reduceWith(compositionOf, x => x, fns);
```

---

### so what's a transducer?

Given reductions written in this style:

```javascript
reduceWith(squaresOfTheOddNumbers(sumOf), 0, one2ten)
```

We can note that we have four separate elements: A transformer for the reducer (which may be a composition of transformers), a seed, and an iterable. If we tease these into separate parameters, we get:[^xf]

[^xf]: In some programming communities, there is a strong sense of conservation with respect to characters, so `tarnsformer` is abbreviated to `xform` or even `xf`. Don't be surprised if you see writing like `(xf, reduce, seed, coll)`, or `xf((val, acc) => acc) -> (val, acc) => acc`. We're not going to do that here, but we have no problem with a name like `xf` or `xform` in production code.

```javascript
const transduce = (transformer, reducer, seed, iterable) => {
  const transformedReducer = transformer(reducer);
  let accumulation = seed;

  for (const value of iterable) {
    accumulation = transformedReducer(accumulation, value);
  }

  return accumulation;
}

transduce(squaresOfTheOddNumbers, sumOf, 0, one2ten)
  //=> 165
```

And there you have it: A *reducer* is the kind of function youâd pass to `.reduce`âit takes an accumulated result and a new input, and returns a new accumulated result. A *transformer* is a function that transforms a reducer into another reducer. And a *transducer* ("transformer" plus "reducer," get it?) is a function that takes a transformer, a reducer, a seed, and an iterable and reduces it to a value.

The elegance of the transducer pattern is that transformers compose naturally to produce new transformers. So we can chain as many transformers together as we like, and since we end up with one transformed reducer, we only iterate over the collection once. We don't need to create intermediate copies of the data or iterate over it multiple times.

Transducers come to us from the [Clojure] programming community, but as you can see they "cut with JavaScript's grain" and are a natural fit for what JavaScript makes easy.

[Clojure]: https://clojure.org/reference/transducers

So, if someone asks us what a "transducer" is, we can now reply:

![What's the problem?](/assets/images/what-s-the-problem.png)

---

### afterward

The code we've written to explore transducers is quite compact and elegant:

```javascript
const arrayOf = (acc, val) => { acc.push(val); return acc; };

const sumOf = (acc, val) => acc + val;

const setOf = (acc, val) => acc.add(val);

const map =
  fn =>
    reducer =>
      (acc, val) => reducer(acc, fn(val));

const filter =
  fn =>
    reducer =>
      (acc, val) =>
        fn(val) ? reducer(acc, val) : acc;

const compose = (...fns) =>
  fns.reduce((acc, val) => (...args) => val(acc(...args)), x => x);

const transduce = (transformer, reducer, seed, iterable) => {
  const transformedReducer = transformer(reducer);
  let accumulation = seed;

  for (const value of iterable) {
    accumulation = transformedReducer(accumulation, value);
  }

  return accumulation;
}
```

It covers all of the cases that we would currently use `.map`, `.filter`, and `.reduce` for with arrays, and the composable transducers don't make multiple copies of the data set. Transducers as developed for production code bases cover more use cases, such as replicating the functionality of `.find`.

Another case libraries cover is this: Our `transduce` function assumes that the collection is iterable, and it demands that we provide the seed and reducer functions. In most cases, the seed and reducer functions are the same for all collections of the same type.

OOP has solved this problem with polymorphism, of course. Collections have methods, so if you invoke the right method, you get the right thing back. Production-class libraries provide an interface for collection types to operate gracefully with transducers.

But this is enough to grasp the pattern behind transducers, and once again to embrace the elegant possibilities when a language provides functions as first-class values.

### the transducer approach to tracking user transitions

(see [Using iterators to write highly composeable code][previous-post] for context.)

```javascript
const logContents = `1a2ddc2, 5f2b932
f1a543f, 5890595
3abe124, bd11537
f1a543f, 5f2b932

const asStream = function * (iterable) { yield * iterable; };

const lines = str => str.split('\n');
const streamOfLines = asStream(lines(logContents));

const datums = str => str.split(', ');
const datumize = map(datums);

const userKey = ([user, _]) => user;

const pairMaker = () => {
  let wip = [];

  return reducer =>
    (acc, val) => {
      wip.push(val);

      if (wip.length === 2) {
        const pair = wip;
        wip = wip.slice(1);
        return reducer(acc, pair);
      } else {
        return acc;

  }
}

        let decoratedReducer;

        if (decoratedReducersByKey.has(key)) {
          decoratedReducer = decoratedReducersByKey.get(key);
        } else {
          decoratedReducer = xfMaker()(reducer);
          decoratedReducersByKey.set(key, decoratedReducer);
        }

      } else if (count > wasCount) {
        return [new Set([transitionKey]), count];
      } else {
        wasKeys.add(transitionKey);
        return [wasKeys, wasCount];
      }
    }
    , [new Set(), 0]
  );

greatestValue(
  transduce(transitionKeys, countsOf, new Map(), streamOfLines)
)
  //=>
    [
      "5f2b932 -> bd11537",
      "bd11537 -> 5890595"
    ],
    4
```

### loanwords

A **loanword** is a term taken from another language and used without translation; it has a specific meaning that (typically) does not otherwise exist in a single English word. Sometimes the wordâ€™s spelling or pronunciation (or both) is slightly altered to accommodate English orthography, but, in most cases, it is preserved in its original language.

*RÃ©sumÃ©* (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) and *kindergarten* (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª) are loanwords.

### calques

A **calque**, on the other hand, is a word or phrase taken from another language but translated (either in part or in whole) to corresponding English words while still retaining the original meaning.

*Forget-me-not* calques Old French's *ne m'oubliez mye*. *Beer garden* calques German's *biergarten*.

### the grand conclusion

But wait! *Calque* is a word taken from French and used without translation, so *calque* is a loanword! Meanwhile, *loanword* calques German's *lehnwort*.

Therefore... *"Loanword" is a calque, and "calque" is a loanword!*

# Egocentricity

- When I'm thinking about things to say and write, I'm being _generative_. Everything comes from the same source: A set of beliefs and thought processes that are all roughly consistent. The consequence of this is that the ideas I come up with will magically pass my own sniff test and feel right, because my test for "right" comes from the same corpus--literally--as the ideas being tested. That is a problem.

# Protagonists and NPCs

_One model of life is to see it as writing a story, and one seeks to write a good story._

- Every scene told from my point of view is likely one where I'm the protagonist. It makes everyone else minor characters, "NPCs" in game parlance. They are there to serve _my_ story.
- Reimagining scenes such that they are told from someone else's point of view doesn't make them the protagonist. The novel "The Spy Who Loved Me" is told from the Bond Girls' perspective, but Bond is the protagonist.
- In every interaction between me and another person, we each have a story. To reify the other people as first-class participants and not just NPCs, I need to ask, "what choice should I make to serve _their_ stiry?

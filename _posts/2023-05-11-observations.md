# Ego centricity

- When I'm thinking about things to say and write, I'm being _generative_. Everything comes from the same source: A set of beliefs and thought processes that are all roughly consistent. The consequence of this is that the ideas I come up with will magically pass my own sniff test and feel right, because my test for "right" comes from the same corpus--literally--as the ideas being tested. That is a problem.

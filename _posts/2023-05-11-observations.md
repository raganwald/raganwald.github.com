# Egocentricity

- When I'm thinking about things to say and write, I'm being _generative_. Everything comes from the same source: A set of beliefs and thought processes that are all roughly consistent. The consequence of this is that the ideas I come up with will magically pass my own sniff test and feel right, because my test for "right" comes from the same corpus--literally--as the ideas being tested. That is a problem.

# Protagonists and NPCs

_One model of life is to see it as writing a story, and one seeks to write a good story._

- Every scene told from my point of view is likely one where I'm the protagonist. It makes everyone else minor characters, "NPCs" in game parlance. They are there to serve _my_ story.
- Reimagining scenes such that they are told from someone else's point of view doesn't make them the protagonist. The novel "The Spy Who Loved Me" is told from the Bond Girls' perspective, but Bond is the protagonist.
- In every interaction between me and another person, we each have a story. To reify the other people as first-class participants and not just NPCs, I need to ask, "what choice should I make to serve _their_ stiry?
- Jokes, banter, and humour are ways people have of reinforcing bonds, not making them. Joiners smell that this is cosplay and are repelled by it.

# ~Air~ Supply

- Interrupting people to tell them I know something about what they are telling me is rude, even if I tell myself I'm sharing something they may find inteersting. If it's that interesting, I can tell them later.
- Jokes, banter, and humour of any kind on the flightline is succumbing to the thirst. Continue to write them all down, it forces attention and leverages the Hawthorne Effect.

# The Path

- It is corrosive to my soul to be competitive as an expression of anger.
- It is corrosive to my soul to allow the thirst to currupt my path into a competition.
- Taking a step on the path does not entitle me to lecture people about the path. Doing so actually means I have forgotten why the path matters.

# The Soul

- My soul is as real as my bank account.

> Anansi is the child of the godly manifestations of his mother the Earth (Asaase Yaa) and his father the Sky (Nyame), so is a true representation of all things on heaven and earth. He has many children with his wife Aso, but the most notable child is Ntikuma, a boy who plays a significant part in one of the more popular legends, regarding the bringing of wisdom to the world.

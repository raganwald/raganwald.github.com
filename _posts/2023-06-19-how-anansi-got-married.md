# Appendices

### hamiltonian ideas

- "Aso's Story."
  - Why are we writing about Anansi?
  - Am I the right person to write a story about a woman?
- "Anansi and Aso, A Love Story"
  - What if this is a character-driven story arc and not just a thin device for framing puzzles?
- "Young Anansi"
  - Who was he before he became a Spider-Man?
- Hip-Hop
  - The Revolution Will Not Be Televised
  - Strange Fruit
  - The Message

### puzzle devices

- A library of all games: Prove it cannot exist via the Wonderful Set: The existance of a game where you can only choose a game that does not choose itself implies an impossible set. Does this mean that you cannot 'fix' Hypergame by demanding that a player choose any game that does not permit choosing itself?
- Could the library be a magic tree?
- Two-player games are congruent to a graph where every node is a "position," and outbound arcs represent the transition to another position with the other player's turn to play. Although these are "moves" we think of as being "within" a game, we can show the equivalence by positing that there is a game somewhere with the same setup as an intermediate move from another game. Thus, all games consist of choosing another game for the other player to play, until a terminal position is reached with no outbound moves.
- Computing machines using oware boards and a set of instructions for manipulating them. Idea: Register machines using pits for registers and stones for the contents of the register. A Minsky Machine in pits and pebbles... Grand reveal is a Universal Minsky Machine.
- Every Minsky Machine is congruent to some Minsky Game, it's just that every position in the game has exactly one allowable move.
- Halting problem congruent to the generalized "Is any arbitrary game totally finite?"
- A subset of Warri games are universal computing machines
- [Rule 110] automaton as kente cloth weaving. A [Cyclic Tag System] as an Oware game?
- A retelling of [Anansi and the Pot of Wisdom][pot], where the pot doesn't actually break, what breaks is rationality, thanks to Anasi discovering paradoxes. Nyame warns Anansi not to starre too deeply into it, but he is greedy, and breaks the pot. Something about statements of what is in the pot proving that there are true things that are not in the pot? Pot congruent to proveable?

### story devices

- How Anansi got married is congruent to the game "Warri" coming from marriage
- Classic hidden romance story where a young Anansi meets a Hausa who wears robes, turban, and face scarf against the desert. Or maybe disguised as a [Taureg], including a blue veil in the style of "blue people."
- Anansi plays warri with this person night after night, recounts his troubles, and is given hints for solutions
- The big reveal is that it is Aso in disguise
- Aso beats Anansi nearly always, because Anansi is "too clever by half," he always tried to win quickly through trickery, and puts more work into his tricks than into winning with soun dplay
- Anansi's trickery is entertaining, though, and reflects a sense of "outsider humour:" Anansi does not want to become dour like the wealthy traders.
- The puzzles all reveal deep, DEEP truths that are lost at the end when Anasi breaks the pot with all the knowledge of the world, leaving tghem to be rediscovered many years later.

### research on games

- [finite games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_game) on Wikipedia, introducing totally finite and somewhat finite games. Supergame is a somewhat final game that is not paradoxical because it demands that its player choose a totally finite game. Hypergame is outside of finite-ness because it allows for the choice of a somewhat final game.
- [Countable set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set), the foundation of the adjective "countably many," implying aleph-zero.

### research on anansi

- [Anansi's Wife](https://lionking.fandom.com/wiki/Anansi%27s_wife)
- [Anansi's Family and Origins](https://brickthology.com/2020/11/29/anansi/)
- An interesting retelling of the "box of stories" myth, which is also the 'pot of wisdowm" myth: [Anansi and the Box of Stories](https://playsonideas.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/anansi_stories-3.pdf)
- [Anansi's Wife and Family](http://anansistories.com/Anansi_Family.html), including a list of his children, each of whom has a special ability.

> Anansi is the child of the godly manifestations of his mother the Earth (Asaase Yaa) and his father the Sky (Nyame), so is a true representation of all things on heaven and earth. He has many children with his wife Aso, but the most notable child is Ntikuma, a boy who plays a significant part in one of the more popular legends, regarding the bringing of wisdom to the world.

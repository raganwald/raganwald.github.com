					<div style="clear:both;"></div>I really said <a href="http://raganwald.github.com/2007/03/ad-hominem.html" title="ad Hominem">all this before</a>, but it seems that the world does <em>not</em> hang on my every utterance for guidance in their affairs.<br /><br />So I&rsquo;ll say it again: Calling someone a &ldquo;<a href="http://reddit.com/search?q=fanboy">fanboy</a>&rdquo; weakens your argument, not strengthens it. It makes your argument look like it emerged straight from an AOL chat room.<br /><br />Compare:<br /><br /><blockquote>Surprisingly, more than half of the labels on the iTunes Music Store are either exclusive or with at most one other store.</blockquote><br />And:<br /><br /><blockquote>It may surprise Apple fanboys, but more than half of the labels on the iTunes Music Store are either exclusive or with at most one other store.</blockquote><br />Does the second one really make its author seem hip and cool and smart at the expense of those hapless Apple fanboys? I didn&rsquo;t think so either.<br /><br />Look, if not wanting to be mistaken for an immature kid isn&rsquo;t enough reason to avoid this word, I have a much better reason.<br /><br />In any conflict, there is a strategic advantage for one side or the other to increase volatility. If you have a lead and a small advantage in games, you want to settle things down and let statistics do their thing. In match-play backgammon, for example, when you have match equity on your side you want to be very conservative with the cube.<br /><br />You want to reduce volatility when you have an advantage and increase volatility when you&rsquo;re behind.<br /><br />Inflammatory labels are a way of increasing volatility, of shaking things up. And the same rule applies: if you&rsquo;re in the right, if your arguments are cogent, you want to keep things rational and logical.<br /><br />But if you&rsquo;re weak, if your ideas are not sound, the only way to win is to turn a discussion into a brawl, and hope you catch a break.<br /><br />I trust that your ideas are sound. So don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of increasing volatility.<br /><br />p.s. And if someone else hangs that label on you? Take satisfaction in the fact that <em>they just admitted that their ideas are too weak to stand alone</em>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;

								<a name="2762231829853073742"></a> 				Hmm, you have me wondering if "fanboy" is always derogatory. I recall using it on my blog <A HREF="http://www.postal-code.com/mrhappy/blog/2006/08/07/thurrott-vs-ie-7-i-hate-you/" REL="nofollow">to describe Paul Thurrott</A> but it wasn't meant as a negative but rather as an admission of, and deference to, his vastly superior knowledge on the subject in question (meant akin to the way someone who isn't a software developer might call me a "geek" when describing my technical proficiency).<BR/><BR/>In my mind "fanboy" comes down to the intent of the author and tone of the statement, is it belittling or not? Or is it always? Now I wonder....<br />

I bring up Raymond because it may be that I am drawing a conclusion based on a combination of both of your activities. Consider that a disclaimer.<BR/><BR/>While I honestly enjoy these posts as much as any (ok, I like the programming stuff more) and wouldn't want to discourage more output, I can't help but wonder if maybe your posts are a sign of "blog fatigue" and that maybe you need a break. <BR/><BR/>I know you don't post for my benefit and I don't know you personally but I'd be sorry to see you burn out and quit blogging. Hopefully you're just shining some light on a topic that has caught your attention and that's that.<BR/><BR/>Respectfully yours,<BR/>Nico<br />

								<a name="8706665419175170686"></a> 				"Fanboy" can actually be a useful shorthand.  Since we don't have time to do a background check on everyone we read online, we have to rely on reputation.  Saying someone is an "X fanboy" means that their views on X are narrow and positively biased.  Often it's not clear that a particular piece is biased, since it can be biased by presenting reasonable benefits and ignoring non-obvious costs.  Unfortunately, much of the internet falls into this category.<br />

								<a name="7912759409062741539"></a> 				Ad hominem is logically fallacious but useful, because it often takes a lot of time to vet an argument.  Say someone makes a claim about the physics of global warming that benefits Texaco's interests.  Tracking down the science of it can be difficult -- at worst, you would have to get a degree in atmospheric physics to weigh the literature.  Now say you learn that that person was paid $1 million by Texaco last year.  *Logically*, this shouldn't change your views, but in reality you are well-served by automatically discounting this claim.<BR/><BR/>I don't know "how interesting" you find this -- it seems pretty obvious to me.<br />

								<a name="8178505723892491993"></a> 				I was not being sarcastic, I find the question interesting. As an aside, you may not have a lot of experience talking to people with an open mind, but you are doing so in this case.<BR/><BR/>I find the question of someone's reputation very interesting and relevant on line, and I have blogged about that. However, I do not  think that someone's reputation affects the truth or falsity of their arguments.<BR/><BR/>Do you grasp the difference?<BR/><BR/>Now, with respect to vetting an argument, haven't we wandered off topic?<BR/><BR/>The post was pointing out that calling someone a fanboy weakens your argument.<BR/><BR/>So for example, if I say that Scheme is a powerful language, perhaps you might point out that I wrote a Scheme implementation, therefore I am biased in some way.<BR/><BR/>You say, "This is <I>useful</I>, because I might not enumerate all of Scheme's weaknesses next to its strengths."<BR/><BR/>Well, that may or may not be true, but it still doesn't invalidate anything I said about Scheme. What I said is true or it isn't.<BR/><BR/>If it is true, my bias doesn't make it go away (It makes someone with a bias the most likely person to point that out, which unfortunately adds little or no informational content to the debate: there is a <I>selection bias</I> at work.)<BR/><BR/>And if it is false, just say so. Failing to point out a flaw in my argument looks an awful lot like there isn't a flaw in my argument.<BR/><BR/>If we are discussing something that requires a lot of effort to track down and validate, perhaps you would be best served by doing so.<BR/><BR/>Remember, the goal here is to learn and develop. For example, someone claimed that Ruby was powerful because of its <I>design</I>, not a specific feature.<BR/><BR/>As a Schemer, this was <A HREF="http://raganwald.github.com/2005/10/im-not-young-enough-to-know-everything.html" REL="nofollow">hard for me to grasp without actually trying it seriously</A>. So a lot of effort was required to validate the claim.<BR/><BR/>But you know what? I knew I would learn something from taking the time to find out.<BR/><BR/>That's the basis of the rational approach. The scientific method. Empirical evidence.<BR/><BR/>The other way... we call that "playing the man and not the ball."<br />

								<a name="2958046536233875887"></a> 				<I>Do you grasp the difference?</I><BR/><BR/>I'm not sure if you were trying to be condescending here, but...  wow.  If you were, you succeeded admirably.<BR/><BR/><I>That's the basis of the rational approach. The scientific method. Empirical evidence.<BR/><BR/>The other way... we call that "playing the man and not the ball."</I><BR/><BR/>Well, any good rugby player will tell you that each has its place ;).<BR/><BR/>I agree that reputation doesn't affect the truth of someone's arguments, but that's not usually what's at issue in online<BR/>discussions.  Most blog writing is advocacy or polemics, both forms of rhetoric.  So the ultimate goal is to persuade others of a particular position.  Making sound and valid logical arguments is one tool for this.  Other "alternative" tools include selectively presenting the facts that support your case is another, shifting the debate to more favorable ground and, yes, questioning your opponent's credibility.  I think this is the context where "fanboy" gets used, and it's a fair play.<BR/><BR/>Note that none of these "alternative" techniques weaken your argument in the sense of damaging the soundness or validity of its logical part.  It has no effect one way or the other.  The fact that you choose to question an opponent's credibility may suggest that you don't have strong arguments to make, but that's just another part of the rhetorical game.<BR/><BR/>I think we agree that, in a discussion genuinely searching for truth, the various alternative methods are unhelpful.  (Our legal system operates in more of a no-holds-barred fashion...)  But I also believe genuine truth-seeking is rare in the blogs.<br />

I found your blog through the tech posts, which I do in fact enjoy.  <BR/><BR/>On the other hand, a decade or more of usenet makes you see demagogues everywhere.<br />

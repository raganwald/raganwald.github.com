<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Erich Finkelstein introduced me to the "balancing rocks" interview question. It's
a math puzzle of the style you'll find at <a href="http://www.techinterview.org/">techinterview.org</a>. The nice
thing about rock balancing is that it isn't an "aha" problem: there are several solutions of varying quality, so
candidates have a great chance to show off their smarts by asking smart questions and considering various aproaches.
</P>
<P>I'm not going to describe the math puzzle, but lately I've been asking candidates to check the correctness of
their answers the nerdy way: by writing a program that checks it for them (ok, I usually don't have a lot of time,
so I ask the candidate to write the algorithm out). In adherence with the Golden Rule,
here're a few versions I whipped up in a few minutes (each) that do the job.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These classes are part of a personal research project. I don't
want to say too much about the project: the point is to create a working application, not
a research thesis. I arbitrarily grabbed a few source code files that I happened
to be editing when I decided asynchronously to update this page. They aren't complete and
I guarantee they will have changed by the time you read this.
</P>
<P>Anyways, the idea exposited by this source code is that this application is event-centric:
instead of investing 80 percent of the architcture in the domain model and 20 percent in the
transactions that modify the domain, this application invests 80 percent of the architecture
in the events that cause changes to the domain ("Domain Events") and only 20 percent in modelling the domain
itself.

<H4><A NAME="WorseIsBetter">Adding Continuations to the Java Programming Language</A></H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These classes are part of another personal research project. My interest
was in adding continuations to the Java Programming Language so that web applications could be
written in Java using a Cocoon or Seaside style of programming. The benefit is that much of the
session state management in a modern web application simply goes away, making software development
simpler and more reliable. And as an added bonus, the new window, back button, and bookmarks all work all
of the time, eliminating my major irritation with treating web browsers like a desktop GUI.
</P>
<P>This &quot;Big Idea&quot; is that in a standard web application we cannot obtain information from
the user in the middle of a method: we therefore cannot model a series of UI steps in a single method.
Although some folks feel that isn't a good idea, the fact is that lots of web applications do have a series
of sequential steps: try checking out of almost any e-commerce site.
</P>
<P>The basis of the system is to rewrite Java methods so that they become 're-entrant': they become a
loop enclosing a big switch statement, with all state stored in a big vector of parameters. The method
can be restarted arbitrarily by passing in the current state and a label. The sample classes handle some
of the Abstract Syntax Tree transformations required to flatten the tree into one level so that it can be
rewritten as a switch statement.
</P>
<P>The basis for the transformation is that the Java byte codes are parsed and
   mechanically transformed into an intermediate language. Certain special forms
   that would be keywords are represented as special static methods of a dummy
   class: those methods are turned into special forms in the intermediate
   language. In a tradition dating back to 1957, the intermediate language
   has an ascii representation featuring Lots of Interesting and Special
   Parentheses. That representation appears often in the test cases: it also
   makes it easy to decouple testing of the transformations from testing of
   the byte code parsing.

			<P>Certain patterns in the AST are rewritten to simplify optimization and transformation.
			A let/call/cc form is a place where a method can be restarted. In a web application, every
			form presented to the user is a restartable place in the computation. The let/call/cc special form
			names the restartable place so that a form can be submitted back to this place in the computation.
			This class transforms the code into a sequence of steps featuring a label that can become the 
			target of the enclosing switch statement.</P>

<H4><A name ="xsl">Code Generation for Struts Development</A></H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When working with large Struts development projects,
managing changes to the struts-config file and your action classes is essential. I developed
a collection of code generators in XSL that transformed a struts config file into a collection
of action classes, interfaces, and business logic abstract base classes.</P>
<P>This is useful if you have a tool automatically building the struts-config file from a source like a spreadsheet.
    Automatic generation saves a little coding time up front, but its real benefit is when the design goes through
    the inevitable refactoring: the classes are automatically updated and strong typing catches any places where
    business logic classes have not been updated. Thus, the combination of code generation and type checking
 makes refactoring easier.<BR>&nbsp;

			<P>In conjunction with a build step that applies this XSL sheet to the struts-config.xml file,
    this generates a collection of Action java classes automatically. Each action class forwards to a Delegate class that actually contains
    the business logic. The idea is that a number of different actions might be handled by the same logic class. A
    special attribute added to each element in the structs-config file identifies the appropriate Delegate.</P>
    
    <P>The Action classes are responsible for forwarding action requests. A nice side effect for strong, declarative
    typing enthusiasts is that each forwarding call is strongly typed, documenting and enforcing the proper form bean's type in Java.</P>

			<P>Custom attributes in the struts-config file identify the business logic delegate that is to

			ensure that the handler method takes the correct form parameter (if one is needed) and returns the
			correct bean (if one is neede for viewing).

<P><A NAME="pragmatic">Q: Why isn't this code elegantly formatted,
heavily commented, using every known Design Pattern, and incorporating the latest language tricks
and features? And why doesn't it use the most fashionable technologies like EJBs
or .NET?</A>
</P>
<P>A: I hear this question from time to time. Of course, if you
ask me to write a class on a white board for you, the purpose of the exercise
is to demonstrate the breadth and depth of my experience and knowledge, so
I'm going to try to use a lot of different techniques, especially those you
are already using to develop software.
</P>
<P>However, the samples I'm sharing here are from production applications. They
use the language features of the time: I'm not going to update them. Also, they
reflect a fundamental difference between a theoretical exercise and a product
development project: In the classroom or laboratory, there is a 'best' or 'perfect'
way to do something.
</P>
<P>In a development project, every decision is a balance between doing this one task
as well as possible and the opportunity cost of moving on to fix another bug or
implement another feature. Sometimes you have to just <b>stop</b> when something is
good enough. Not because there isn't some benefit of doing a better job, but
because there's an even greater benefit of wrapping this up and getting started on another
task.

I am a technical product leader whose passion is making something wonderful. I am available for work. And this is not my first rodeo.

### I am technical

I write software, and I write about software. Everything I do with product design, software architecture, and leading the process of shipping software is anchored in more than forty years of shipping software that runs businesses. I've shipped products written with C++, Java, Ruby, Scala, Elixir, JavaScript, and TypeScript, using too many libraries, frameworks, and patterns to list. I also write [technical-essays], speak at [tech-conferences], and I've published several [books] about programming.

### I ship products

The centre of gravity of my approach to shipping is the product and its attendant product strategy. Teams I lead view choices about technology, design, prioritiziation, process, and architecture as acting in service to the product we are shipping and the commitment we make to the organization. I bring to this product focus past professional experience in Enterprise Sales, Consulting, and Marketing. I also leverage my experience as a past-member of both the Toronto Computer-Human Interaction ACM-SIG and the Toronto Product Management Association.

### I lead

 I have shipped software as a Technical Product Manager, Engineering Manager, Program Manager, and Principal Engineer. I integrate my experience as a product-focused technologist into leading teams and groups. In the most recent chapter of my career, I won two company leadership awards for helping our engineering force navigate the challenges of growing from a scrappy startup to a revenue monster and from there to an IPO. I work both within my direct focus and collaboratively across the product, sales, and marketing orgs to ensure we are aligned and in perfect sync on both strategy and execution. 

### My passion is making something wonderful

Software that cuts waste, eliminates errors, and improves productivity is necessary, but insufficient to launch a movement that will one day change the world. I aspire to ship software that leads customers to change the way they think about the work they do. And with that transformation, comes a virtuous flywheel effect: Customers who change the way they work discover new needs and opportunities, which we in turn serve with follow-on features and products.

### I am available for work.

I recently completed nine years as a Principal Engineer with PagerDuty, where I was part of the leadership that took us from M$25 ARR to M$450 ARR. I've also worked for GitHub, Unspace Interactive, and KL Group/Sitraka, where I was the JProbe Threadalyzer TPM and JProbe Suite GPM.

I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my cross-group technical and product-focused experience, within a growing and fast-iteration organization that shares my aspiration to change the world. I'm open to 100% remote roles, or hybrid roles in the Greater Toronto Area.

### this is not my first rodeo

I have shipped a lot of software. I know how to ship, and I am familiar with many things that can threaten shipping, and some of the ways to effectively navigate past the obstacles. I know how engineering and product teams evolve with growth and organizational maturity, and some of the ways to maintain the best and most effective parts of a culture while helping to evolve the parts that no longer serve the mission. I have a vision, I have aspirations, but I know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."

I am exactly what I appear to be: A senior engineer with forty years of product- and customer-centric business and technical experience. A steady veteran who can be relied upon to maintain calm and focus, suppressing uncertainty and maximizing optionality during rapidly evolving circumstances.

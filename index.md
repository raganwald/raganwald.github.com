# Who I Am

I am a technical product leader whose passion is making something wonderful through software.

_I am technical_: I write software, and I write about software. Everything I do with product design, software architecture, and leading the process of shipping software is anchored in more than forty years of shipping software that runs businesses. I am well-known for my experience with Java, Ruby, JavaScript, and TypeScript, but go back far enough and I've shipped working software in Pascal, C++, Elixir, and Scala.

_I am product-focused_: I have shipped products on floppies, I have shipped products on CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs. I have shipped SaaS products. Prior to developing software full-time, I worked in Enterprise Sales, Consulting, and Marketing. I am a past-member of both the Toronto Computer-Human Interaction ACM-SIG and the Toronto Product Management Association. Even when writing infrastructure, my focus is on enabling both the product and the organization wrapped around the product. 

_I am a technical product leader_: I have shipped software as a Technical Product Manager, Engineering Manager, Program Manager, and Principal Engineer. I integrate my experience as a product-focused technologist into leading teams and groups. In the most recent chapter of my career, I won two company leadership awards for helping our engineering force navigate the challenges of growing from a scrappy startup to a revenue monster and from there to an IPO. I work both within my direct focus and collaboratively across the product, sales, and marketing orgs to ensure we are aligned and in perfect sync on both strategy and execution.

My passion is _making something wonderful through software_. Shipping software that cuts costs, removes paper cuts, eliminates mistakes, and improves productivity is necessary, but insufficient to launch a company that may one day become the 800 lb. gorilla of its market. I aspire to ship software that leads customers to change the way they think about their businesses: With their transformation, comes a deep integration between product and process that creates a defensible market position, and supercharges the company's valuation.

I am a technical product leader whose passion is collaboration to make something wonderful. I am available for work. And this is not my first rodeo.

### I am technical

Everything I do with product design, software architecture, and leading the process of shipping software is anchored in almost forty years of shipping software that runs businesses. I've shipped products written with C++, Java, Ruby, Scala, Elixir, JavaScript, and TypeScript, using too many libraries, frameworks, and patterns to list. My progressive experience as a technologist culminated with nine years as a Principal Engineer with PagerDuty. I also write [technical essays][technical-essays], speak at [tech conferences][tech-conferences], and I've published successful [books] about programming.

### I ship products

 I have shipped software as a Technical Product Manager. The centre of gravity of my approach to shipping is the product and its attendant product strategy. Technology, design, prioritiziation, process, and architecture are all in service to the product we ship and our commitment to the business. I bring to this product focus past professional experience in Enterprise Sales, Consulting, and Marketing. I also leverage my experience as a past-member of both the Toronto Computer-Human Interaction ACM-SIG and the Toronto Product Management Association.

 I am strongest in a role that is ⅔ Staff+ Engineer and ⅓ Technical Product Manager, freeing up full-time product managers to focus on customer-facing, market-facting, and GTM execution.

### I lead through collaboration

I integrate my experience as a product-focused technologist into building and leading both teams and groups of teams. In the most recent chapter of my career, I won two company leadership awards for helping our engineering force navigate the challenges of growing from a scrappy startup to a revenue monster and from there to an IPO. I work both within my direct focus and collaboratively across the product, sales, customer success, and marketing orgs to ensure we are aligned on both strategy and execution.

### My passion is making something wonderful

Software that cuts waste, eliminates errors, and improves productivity is necessary, but insufficient to launch a movement that will one day change the world. I aspire to ship software that leads customers to change the way they think about the work they do. And with that transformation, comes a virtuous flywheel effect: Customers who change the way they work discover new needs and opportunities, which we in turn serve with follow-on features and products.

### I grow engineering

I am a strong partner with recruiting, and I'm known both for expertise evaluating prospective engineers, and for my stength closing senior hires. I grow engineering capacity through hiring, through people development, and through technology stewardship. As a founding member of PagerDuty's Architecture Strategy and Front-End Architecture Strategy teams, I help[ed grow our engineering capacity through the adoption of tooling, processes, and even programming language choices that supported scaling engineering capacity.

### I am available for work.

I recently completed nine years as a Principal Engineer with PagerDuty, where I was part of the leadership that took us from M$25 ARR to M$450 ARR. I've also worked for GitHub, Unspace Interactive, and KL Group/Sitraka, where I was the JProbe Threadalyzer TPM and JProbe Suite GPM.

I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my cross-group technical and product-focused experience, within a growing and fast-iteration organization that shares my aspiration to change the world.

### this is not my first rodeo

I have shipped a lot of software. I know how to ship, and I am familiar with many things that can threaten shipping, and some of the ways to effectively navigate past the obstacles. I know how engineering and product teams evolve with growth and organizational maturity, and some of the ways to maintain the best and most effective parts of a culture while helping to evolve the parts that no longer serve the mission. I am a senior engineer with forty years of product- and customer-centric business and technical experience. A steady veteran who can be relied upon to maintain calm and focus, suppressing uncertainty and maximizing optionality during rapidly evolving circumstances.

I know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."

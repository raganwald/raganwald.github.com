## What I Believe

<a id="fnref:perlisism" role="doc-noteref"/>My aspirations are guided by my belief that improving productivity is building [faster horses]. I believe that a tool that doesn't redefine the way customers think about their work, isn't worth building.<a href="#:~:text=My%20belief%20is%20a%20generalization,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Source">4</a>

## What I Do

### I am technical

I have designed and built software for paying customers since the 1990s:

- <a id="fnref:tableau" role="doc-noteref"/>In the early 90s, I wrote and sold Tableau, classified advertising management for desktop publishers.<a href="#:~:text=I%20wrote%20Tableau%20in,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="More about Tableau">5</a>
- In 1994, I shipped [nCrypt Light], a message encryption tool for the Apple Newton.
- <a id="fnref:templates" role="doc-noteref"/>In the late 1990s, I shipped a server-side templating language for Java.<a href="#:~:text=The%20templating%20language%20was,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="More about the language">6</a>
- <a id="fnref:ceeplusplus" role="doc-noteref"/>In the early 2000s, I was the hands-on Technical Product Manager for [JProbe Threadalyzer], the first tool to perform predictive and actual deadlock and data race detection on Java servers.<a href="#:~:text=Threadalyzer%20was%20written%20in%20C,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Threadalyzer's code and architecture">7</a>
- <a id="fnref:hypercard" role="doc-noteref"/>While serving as Program Manager for the [JProbe Suite], I designed and coded the suite's first configuration tool.<a href="#:~:text=I%20can%20be%20pragmatic,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="An unexpected software platform">8</a>
- <a id="fnref:mumps" role="doc-noteref"/>In the mid 2000s, I led the web banking team for [ING Direct (USA)][ING], with more than three million active users.

### I ship products

My career-long focus is the product strategy and development process around both technical and business tools:

- As the Technical Product Manager for JProbe Threadalyzer, I performed user research, developed the value proposition, and designed the product.
- As the Program Manager for the JProbe Suite, I collaborated with Sales and Marketing Product Management on prioritization and positioning, acted as the media contact for feature-detailed interviews and demos, and manned the booth at JavaOne.
- At Github, I created the prose-specific heuristics, designed and developed the user experience, and shipped [rich prose diffs].
- At PagerDuty—working with Product Mangement and Marketing Strategy—I wrote the technical road map for [schedules], identifying feasible and compelling features to establish strong differentiation from our competitors and value complements.
- <a id="fnref:tilting-at-windmills" role="doc-noteref"/>At PagerDuty, my teams ideated, developed, and shipped [insights] and [operational review] features, and launched [response mobilizer].<a href="#:~:text=Not%20everything%20I%20championed,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Windmills I tilted at">10</a>

<p class="quotation">Reg and I worked together for a year and a half. During that time, he spearheaded the effort to produce JProbe Threadalyzer, and then shepherded the entire JProbe suite through two subsequent upgrade releases.</p>
<p class="quotation">By that time, Threadalyzer had all but eliminated its competition in the Java thread analysis space, and JProbe had become the company's major source of revenue.</p>

### I lead engineering growth

I grow engineering in headcount, in scale of operations, in process maturity, and in tooling sophistication. 

- I've led technical interviews throughout my career and partnered with Talent on initiatives. At PagerDuty, I was recognized for using the interview process to close senior hires.
- <a id="fnref:tooling" role="doc-noteref"/>As a member of PagerDuty's Architecture Strategy and Front-End Architecture Strategy teams, I led or co-led the adoption of tooling, process, and language choices that supported scaling engineering capacity.<a href="#:~:text=Ask%20me%20about%20my%20experience%20adopting,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Tooling initiatives">11</a>
- <a id="fnref:pd-growth" role="doc-noteref"/>I helped PagerDuty's engineering successfully navigate the product/market fit refinement phase, a rapid sales growth phase, and a post-IPO transition to efficient and predictible scaling phase.<a href="#:~:text=During%20my%20tenure%2C%20PagerDuty,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="PagerDuty’s revenue growth">12</a>

### I foster collaboration

At PagerDuty, in addition to the [product](#i-ship-products) and [engineering growth](#i-lead-engineering-growth) outcomes above, I also collaborated across group and functional lines:

- <a id="fnref:awards" role="doc-noteref"/>I was recognized with two leadership awards at PagerDuty.<a href="#:~:text=I%20treasure%20the%20tombstones,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="PagerDuty’s revenue growth">13</a>
- I developed an internal capability supporting refined product management shipping strategies.
- I ideated and prototyped features and products in partnership with my Product and Leadership colleagues.
- I led our own Incident Management practice.
- I have MC'd the company's annual kickoff, and co-hosted the company's [IPO Breakfast Party](/assets/images/ipo-breakfast.jpg).
- I launched and supported a more rigorous iteration of Engineering's Design Review process.
- I launched and led technical and organizational reorganizations and process iterations.

## What's Next?

### This is not my first rodeo

I bring forty years of product- and customer- centric business and technical experience to shipping on time, without drama:

- I have experienced both the highs and the lows of the startup trajectory, and I guide my teams with a steady hand on the tiller.
- My teams know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."

<p class="quotation">Reg is one of the finest software engineering professionals I have ever worked with. He has great vision for product development, a strong sense of cultural fit for complex companies, and the vision to help scale an engineering group.
Any growing organization would be fortunate to add Reg to its team.</p>

1. The templating language was loosely based on [Scheme], while borrowing some syntactic sugar from Smalltalk.

1. Conversagent is no longer active, however I retained this [intervew with the founder](assets/images/conversagent.jpg). The title of "Vice-President was largely ceremonial: I was the head of development, but this was a team of three engineers and a product manager. Our incubator insisted that we needed a VP, so I got the title.

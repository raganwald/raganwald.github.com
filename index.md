## What I Do

### I am technical

I have written and shipped software products and services since the 1990s:

- <a id="fnref:expression-toggles" role="doc-noteref"/>In 2015, I joined PagerDuty as its first Principal Engineer for Applications: I co-wrote features such as [insights]. I designed and wrote foundational code for [response mobilizer], [operational reviews][operational review], [stakeholder communications], and [round-robin scheduling].<br/><br>I also led and/or collaborated upon the rearchitecting of our front-end code from CoffeeScript/Backbone to JavaScript/Ember and then supported our transition to TypeScript/React. I personally restructured our incident management code, such as refactoring the core logic of one of our services into a state machine to make it extensible with out drama.<br/><br>I rewrote our scheduling engine’s core to handle a large customer’s requirement to handle complexity mmany orders of magnitude more than previously encountered, I brought real-time live updates to incident management, and I created a domain-specific expression language for feature toggles based on set operations.<a href="#:~:text=Expression%20toggles%20are,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Expression Toggles">3</a><
- At GitHub, I wrote features such as [rendered prose diffs], for which I wrote a custom HTML diff algorithm in a Ruby gem as well as the front-end UX in JavaScript.
- <a id="fnref:mumps" role="doc-noteref"/>In the mid 2000s, I led the web banking team for [ING Direct (USA)][ING], with more than three million active users. I wrote features such as its first online ATM and Café locator, and shipped online banking features within a WebSphere, Oracle, Java, and era-appropriate front-end environment.<br/><br/>I also led the development of an insurance customer-service application that delivered a very large number of no-code customized forms. I designed a configuration language for the forms and a JavaScript interpreter that acted as an embedded service both delivering the forms and providing real-time validation. This was executed directly in the browser for latency reasons, and also ran within the Java-based backend using Rhino to ensure 100% alignment of validation rules.<br/><br/>I know how to move fast without breaking people’s life savings or insurance needs.<a href="#:~:text=Ask%20me%20about%20MUMPS%20and%20JDBC,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="More about legacy technologies">4</a>
- <a id="fnref:hypercard" role="doc-noteref"/>While serving as Program Manager for the [JProbe Suite], I designed and coded the suite's first configuration tool.<a href="#:~:text=I%20wrote%20the%20configuration%20tool%20in MetaCard,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="An unexpected software platform">5</a>
- <a id="fnref:ceeplusplus" role="doc-noteref"/>In the early 2000s, I was the hands-on Technical Product Manager for [JProbe Threadalyzer], the first tool to perform predictive and actual deadlock and data race detection on Java servers.<a href="#:~:text=Threadalyzer%20was%20written%20in%20C,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Threadalyzer's code and architecture">6</a>
- <a id="fnref:templates" role="doc-noteref"/>In the late 1990s, I shipped a server-side templating language for Java.<a href="#:~:text=The%20templating%20language%20was,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="More about the language">7</a>
- In 1994, I shipped [nCrypt Light], a message encryption tool for the Apple Newton.
- <a id="fnref:tableau" role="doc-noteref"/>In the early 90s, I wrote and sold my own classified ad management application for desktop publishers.<a href="#:~:text=Long%20before%20Tableau,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Tableau I">8</a>

### I ship products

My career-long focus is the product strategy and development process around both technical and business tools:

- <a id="fnref:tilting-at-windmills" role="doc-noteref"/>At PagerDuty, I partnered with Product to launch [response mobilizer], [operational reviews][operational review], [stakeholder communications], and [round-robin scheduling]. I wrote the technical road map for [schedules]. Working with Product, I created prototypes for features such as [recent changes]. <a href="#:~:text=Not%20everything%20I%20championed,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Windmills I tilted at">9</a>
- At Github, I created the prose-specific heuristics, designed and developed the user experience, and shipped [rendered prose diffs].
- As the Program Manager for the JProbe Suite, I collaborated with Sales and Marketing Product Management on prioritization and positioning, acted as the media contact for feature-detailed interviews and demos, and manned the booth at JavaOne.
- As the Technical Product Manager for JProbe Threadalyzer, I performed user research, developed the value proposition, and designed the product.

<p class="quotation">Reg is one of those exceptional colleagues who makes an extraordinary contribution not only to his team, but also to his teammates as individuals. Working with Reg made me a better product manager, and I saw how he was similarly committed to the growth of everyone on the team.</p>
<p class="quotation">To his deep wealth of experience, Reg brings unique creativity and infectious enthusiasm. He is that rare product leader who can share his vision effectively, lay out a clear plan to achieve it, and then go on the journey with his team step by step until they get there.</p>

My approach to product strategy is informed by my beliefs:

- <a id="fnref:perlisism" role="doc-noteref"/>I believe that improving productivity is building [faster horses]. I believe that a tool that doesn't redefine the way customers think about their work, isn't worth building.<a href="#:~:text=My%20belief%20is%20a%20generalization,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Source">10</a>
- <a id="fnref:table-stakes" role="doc-noteref"/>I believe that "table stakes" for product functionality is defined by similar features in mass-market products, not by market competitors. Text editing must be judged in comparison to Google Docs; calendars/schedules must be judged in comparison to Google Calendar.<a href="#:~:text=Yes%20this%20does%20mean%20thinking%20hard%20about%20supporting,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="Source">11</a>

<p class="quotation">Loved the unique and always well researched and thoughtful invites that Reg brought to deep technical conversations and especially the way he showed up as a person, engineer and colleague. Easily one of those rare people that can go wide and deep on a topic. Reg supercharged an organization’s most elite thinkers and helps everyone do and get better.</p>

### I recognize when what got us here, won't get us there

I lead incremental and continuous refinement of engineering and product development. I'm conservative about changing horses in mid-stream, however I also recognize when factors combine to create a situation where “what got us here, won't get us there.” When that happens, I embrace change that is both comprehensive and necessarily disruptive.

- In the late 1990s, software products exploded in size and complexity, leading to higher development risks. Managing those risks with increasingly rigid BDUF+Waterfall became counterproductive. Accordingly, I adapted SCRUM from the consulting world to product development at Sitraka, delivering on-time and highly successful releases for Threadalyzer and then the JProbe Suite by focusing on delivering iterations of the complete product on a fixed cadence with continuous update of the plan.
- In the 2000s through 2010s, the business benefits of iterative development were gated by the ability of developers to complete bigger and bigger features in shorter and shorter cycles. Accordingly, I was an early adopter and public champion of moving from strongly typed languages like C++ and Java to lightweight but expressive languages like Ruby and JavaScript, driving faster and cheaper product/market fit validation and thus lowering runway exhaustion risk.
- <a id="fnref:pd-growth" role="doc-noteref"/><a id="fnref:tooling" role="doc-noteref"/>More recently, I helped PagerDuty's engineering successfully navigate the product/market fit refinement phase, a rapid sales growth phase, and a post-IPO transition to efficient and predictable scaling phase. Each phase required its own approach to processes, architecture, and tooling.<br/><br/>Accordingly—and in conjunction with my Architecture Strategy Team and Front-End Architecture Strategy Team colleagues—I led or co-led major changes to our product development and engineering practices in conjunction with each phase change. We adopted new tooling, process, and language choices that supported refactoring and scaling our work, architecture, and product.<span class="footnote"><a href="#:~:text=During%20my%20tenure%2C%20PagerDuty,↩" rel="footnote" title="PagerDuty’s revenue growth">12</a>, <a href="#:~:text=Ask%20me%20about%20my%20experience%20adopting,↩" rel="footnote" title="Tooling initiatives">14</a></span>

### I am a strong communicator

I foster a culture of writing and structured communication in both my work and my personal pursuits:

- I write technical documentation;
- I write technical and product road maps;
- I write white papers and other marketecture pieces;
- I write pull requests and design review documents;
- I wrote [JavaScript Allongé](assets/books/javascriptallongesix.pdf) and [other books](https://leanpub.com/u/raganwald) about programming;
- I have created sales and software development training materials;
- I have delivered technical training to my colleagues and at technical conferences;
- I have been an essayist since 2004.

My books, essays, and talks are available on my [creative works page].

### I foster collaboration

At PagerDuty, in addition to the [product](#i-ship-products) and [engineering growth](#i-lead-engineering-growth) outcomes above, I also collaborated across group and functional lines:

- <a id="fnref:awards" role="doc-noteref"/>I was recognized with two leadership awards at PagerDuty.<a href="#:~:text=I%20treasure%20the%20tombstones,↩" class="footnote" rel="footnote" title="PagerDuty’s revenue growth">15</a>
- I developed an internal capability supporting refined product management shipping strategies.
- I ideated and prototyped features and products in partnership with my Product and Leadership colleagues.
- I led our own Incident Management practice.
- I have MC'd the company's annual kickoff, and co-hosted the company's [IPO Breakfast Party](/assets/images/ipo-breakfast.jpg).
- I launched and supported a more rigorous iteration of Engineering's Design Review process.
- I launched and led technical and organizational reorganizations and process iterations.

## I'm available for work.

I bring forty years of product- and customer-centric business and technical experience to shipping on time, without drama:

- I have experienced both the highs and the lows of the startup trajectory, and I guide my teams with a steady hand on the tiller.
- My teams know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."
- I'm ready to apply my experience and proven skills to growing another success.

I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my technical and product focus. I'm [raganwald@gmail.com], and I'm on [LinkedIn].

1. The templating language was loosely based on [Scheme], while borrowing some syntactic sugar from Smalltalk. Its defining feature was that HTML could contain code, code could contain HTML, and so forth [all the way down](https://raganwald.com/assets/images/lisp-based-template-language.png). <a href="#fnref:templates" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>
1. Long before [Tableau from Salesforce][Tableau Corporation] existed, I wrote a classified ad application for desktop publishers. I wrote the code in [4th Dimension] and the [manuals] in PageMaker. I did my own sales, and marketed the product at [MacWorld][reg-at-macworld].

1. Not everything I championed ended up shipping. Ask me about Schedules, Automation, and Collaboration.<a href="#fnref:tilting-at-windmills" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>
1. My belief is a generalization of Dr. Alan Perlis’ observation that “[a language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html#:~:text=A%20language%20that%20doesn't%20affect%20the%20way%20you%20think%20aboutprogramming%2C%20is%20not%20worth%20knowing).” <a href="#fnref:perlisism" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>
1. Yes this does mean thinking hard about supporting functionality like undo/redo stacks, real-time collaborative editing, comments, full-text search, full time zone support, flexible notification preferences, and other affordances that are table stakes for B2C applications. <a href="#fnref:table-stakes" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>

1. **Triskaidekaphobia** (_TRIS-kye-DEK-ə-FOH-bee-ə_ from Ancient Greek τρεισκαίδεκα (treiskaídeka) 'thirteen' and Ancient Greek φόβος (phóbos) 'fear') is fear or avoidance of the number 13.
1. Ask me about my experience adopting or migrating to Ember, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Elixir, and Java. When you ask about evaluating and adopting AI tooling such as Copilot, be sure I cover the [Hawthorne Effect]. <a href="#fnref:tooling" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>

I bootstrapped it with consulting and training, including working as a mentor for first-time entrepreneurs through the YMCA's Enterprise Program and as a Financial Analyst for a boutique investment bank specializing in the food and beverage industry. <a href="#fnref:solo-founder" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>
1. Bonar Associates sold turnkey mini-computer-based classified advertising systems to large “penny-savers,” print newspapers that were primarily classified ads. I made its software customizable so that it could be sold at scale. It was written in TurboPascal with BTrieve, running on an MP/M-based tightly-coupled network. It supported as many as 16 simultaneous users. <a href="#fnref:bonar-associates" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>

I know I joke about you and I being older than many (possibly most) of the engineers at PagerDuty, but I think it's more about being able to relate to one another. You have a long career in technology, and when you, or I, talk about a topic or trend in the industry, I feel we can both relate to one another. You and I are also able to look at what's happening now and make comparisons to what we've seen in the industry over the years.

On that note, I also valued your ability to explain topics in way that others could understand, often through stories, anecdotes, or thought experiments. I found this refreshing, as I've come across Architects and Principal Engineers in the past that simply expected others to understand and looked down on them if they didn't.

I also learned quite a bit from you, not just about PagerDuty or the technologies we used, but about how to be a better technical leader. Some specific areas where I learned from you include looking beyond the obvious or what's right in front of me, communication skills, and the many phrases, sayings, and principles that I had not come across in the past.

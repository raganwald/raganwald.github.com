## What I Believe

<p class="quotation last">Reg is one of the finest software engineering professionals I have ever worked with. He has great vision for product development, a strong sense of cultural fit for complex companies, and the vision to help scale an engineering group.
Any growing organization would be fortunate to add Reg to its team.</p>
<p class="quotation author">Jonathan Poehlman, Senior Technical Recruiter, Elastic</p>

I am guided by my beliefs that:

- All software is social software. I believe that to thrive, software must become the comunications medium or load-bearing source of truth for a critical process.
- Improving productivity is the [faster horses] of enterprise software. I believe that transforming the way customers think about their work, communicate with each other about their work, and do their work together is fundamental to creating and dominating entirely new markets.

## What I Do

### I am technical

<p class="quotation butlast">“Reg was always my ‘secret weapon’ for getting a new initiative off the ground. He understood our code and our product and what it was capable of, and he understood our customers and their needs.</p>

<p class="quotation last">“Reg was exceptional at translating a product manager’s vision for a new feature into an actionable technical plan and architecture given all of the constraints inherent in adapting working software to new capabilities, then getting the rest of the team on-board and executing.”</p>  
<p class="quotation author">Jason Diller: VP of Engineering, Georgias</p>

I have designed and built software for paying customers since the 1990s:

- In the early 90s, I wrote and sold Tableau, classified advertising management for desktop publishers.<sup id="fnref:tableau" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:tableau" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
- In 1994, I shipped [nCrypt Light], a message encryption tool for the Apple Newton.
- In the early 2000s, I was the hands-on Technical Product Manager for [JProbe Threadalyzer], the first tool to perform predictive and actual deadlock and data race detection on Java servers.
- As Program Manager for the [JProbe Suite], I wrote a little code, such as designing and shipping the suite's first configuration tool.
- In the mid 2000s, I led the web banking team for [ING Direct (USA)][ING], with more than three million active users. I personally wrote features such as its first ATM and Café locator. I used Enterprise Architectural Patterns for integration with legacy systems and extending their functionality.<sup id="fnref:mumps" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mumps" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
- As a member of GitHub's documentation tools and front-end flow teams in the early 2010s, I shipped features such as [rich prose diffs].
- In 2015, I was hired as the Principal Engineer for Incident Management. I was PagerDuty's hands-on lead for the [insights] and [operational review] features, and the launch of features such as [response mobilizer]. I wrote prototypes for features such as [recent changes].

### I ship products

<p class="quotation last">“Reg and I worked together for a year and a half. During that time, he spearheaded the effort to produce JProbe Threadalyzer, and then shepherded the entire JProbe suite through two subsequent upgrade releases. By that time, Threadalyzer had all but eliminated its competition in the Java thread analysis space, and JProbe had become KL's major source of revenue.”</p>  
<p class="quotation author">Christian Jaekl: Software Engineer and Concurrency Domain Expert</p>

My career-long focus is the complete product strategy and development workflow around the technical work:

- As the Technical Product Manager for JProbe Threadalyzer, I performed user research, developed the value proposition, and designed the product.
- As the Program Manager for the JProbe Suite, I collaborated with Sales and Marketing Product Management on prioritization and positioning, acted as the media contact for feature-detailed interviews and demos, and manned the booth at JavaOne.
- At Github, I created the prose-specific heuristics, designed and developed the user experience, and shipped [rich prose diffs].
- At PagerDuty—working with Product Mangement and Marketing Strategy—I wrote the technical road map for the company's Scheduling and Workflow features, identifying feasible and compelling features to establish strong differentiation from compatitors and complements.
- At PagerDuty, my teams ideated, developed, and shipped [insights] and [operational review] features, and launched [response mobilizer]. Ask me about [schedules].

### I lead engineering growth

<p class="quotation last">“You were such an anchor and leader at PD! Thank you for the countless interviews, for the always interesting insights, for mentoring so many, and for shaping PD and just being a great person! You are a true PD Hall of Famer and Legend!”</p>  
<p class="quotation author">Richard Hartshorne: Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty</p>

I grow engineering in headcount, in scale of operations, in process maturity, and in tooling sophistication. 

- I've led technical interviews throughout my career and partnered with Talent on initiatives. At PagerDuty, I was recognized for using the interview process to close senior hires.
- As a member of PagerDuty's Architecture Strategy and Front-End Architecture Strategy teams, I led or co-led the adoption of tooling, process, and language choices that supported scaling engineering capacity.
- I helped PagerDuty's engineering successfully navigate the product/market fit refinement phase, a rapid sales growth phase, and a post-IPO transition to efficient and predictible scaling phase.<sup id="fnref:pd-growth" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pd-growth" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>

### I foster collaboration

<p class="quotation butlast">“Extraordinary communication skills... Able to mentor and coach other engineers and make those less experienced comfortable and build their confidence (empowerment) at the same time.</p>
<p class="quotation last">“Reg's communication skills transcended engineering to other parts of the businesses (Product and Executive leadership). And, it is natural leadership... Not forced in any way. He talks to, and gets respect from, the Interns to the C-Level.”</p>  
<p class="quotation author">Richard Hartshorne: Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty</p>

At PagerDuty, in addition to the [product](#i-ship-products) and [engineering growth](#i-lead-engineering-growth) outcomes above, I also collaborated across group and functional lines:

- I was awarded PagerDuty's *Breakthrough* leadership award in 2019 and the *Inclusively Leading and Learning* award in 2022.
- I developed an internal capability supporting refined product management shipping strategies.
- I ideated and prototyped features and products in partnership with my Product and Leadership colleagues.
- I led our own Incident Management practice.
- I have MC'd the company's annual kickoff, and co-hosted the company's [IPO Breakfast Party](/assets/images/ipo-breakfast.jpg).
- I launched and supported a more rigorous iteration of Engineering's Design Review process.
- I launched and led technical and organizational reorganizations and process iterations.

## What's Next?

### This is not my first rodeo

<p class="quotation last">“Reg crossed role and organizational lines to constantly better the company and increase in scale our impact on the market, our products, and customers.”</p>  
<p class="quotation author">Michael Cucci: Investor, Startup Advisor, ex-VP of Product and Marketing, PagerDuty</p>

I bring forty years of product- and customer- centric business and technical experience to shipping on time, without drama:

- I have experienced both the highs and the lows of the startup trajectory, and I guide my teams with a steady hand on the tiller.
- My teams know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."

### I'm available for work.

<p class="quotation last">“You were a huge asset to PagerDuty, and wherever you land next will be lucky to have you.”</p>  
<p class="quotation author">Michael Cucci: Investor, Startup Advisor, ex-VP of Product and Marketing, PagerDuty</p>

If you are looking for a veteran to play a meaningful role in your breakout success:

- My résumé is available upon [request][raganwald@gmail.com].
- My personal email is [raganwald@gmail.com].
- I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my technical and product focus.

### I am Reginald Braithwaite

I am a technical product leader with a passion for collaborating on making something wonderful. I know how to get there by repeatedly shipping "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect." I'm available for work, and this is not my first rodeo. 

I am highly impactful in a role that is functionally two-thirds Staff+ Engineer and one-third Technical Product Manager, with real-time and high-bandwidth collaboration with product management. I have shipped products in this role working within both independent product groups and startups.

I wrote JavaScript Allongé[^fn-ja] amongst other books. I also write technical essays and speak at tech conferences.[^fn-cw] My experience is itemized in more detail on LinkedIn, and a résumé is available upon request. I can be reached via [raganwald@gmail.com].

### I am technical

My code, product design, and software architecture is built om almost forty years of hands-on experience shipping software that runs businesses. I've shipped products written with in C++, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Ember, React, TypeScript, and many more. I 

As a Principal Engineer, my technical scope included but was not limited to writing code that directly powered our product, writing code that powers the product development group around the product, handling critical incidents as an Incident Commander, writing technical product road maps, and collaborating across product group lines to developing, reviewing, and implementing engineering wide technical standards and transitions.

### I ship products

I have shipped software as a Technical Product Manager, Program Manager, and in hands-on engineering roles. Under my leadership and influence, technology, design, prioritization, process, and architecture act in service to the product we ship and our commitment to the business and its attendant product strategy.

My product focus is informed by my professional experience in Consulting, Technology Marketing, and Enterprise Sales. I am a past-member of both the Toronto Computer-Human Interaction ACM-SIG and the Toronto Product Management Association.

### I lead through collaboration

I integrate my experience as a product-focused technologist into building and leading both teams and groups of teams. In the most recent chapter of my career, I won two company leadership awards for helping our engineering force navigate the challenges of growing from a scrappy startup to a revenue monster and from there to an IPO. I work both within my direct focus and collaboratively across the product, sales, customer success, and marketing orgs to ensure we are aligned on both strategy and execution.

### My passion is making something wonderful

My belief is that software that cuts waste, eliminates errors, and improves productivity is necessary, but insufficient to launch a movement that will one day change the world. I aspire to collaboratively ship software that leads customers to change the way they think about the work they do. And with that transformation, comes a virtuous flywheel effect: Customers who change the way they work discover new needs and opportunities, which we in turn serve with follow-on features and products.

### I grow engineering

I am a strong partner with recruiting, and I'm known both for expertise evaluating prospective engineers, and for my stength closing senior hires. I grow engineering capacity through hiring, through people development, and through technology stewardship. As a founding member of PagerDuty's Architecture Strategy and Front-End Architecture Strategy teams, I helped grow our engineering capacity through the adoption of tooling, processes, and even programming language choices that supported scaling engineering capacity horizontally. I understand how to manage culture, talent, and tooling for rapid product iteration and scale, but also how to recognize when growth and strategy trigger organizational change, and how to lead culture, talent, and tooling from the old to the new without drama.

### I am available for work.

I recently completed nine years as a Principal Engineer with PagerDuty, where I was part of the leadership that took us from M$25 ARR to M$450 ARR. I've also worked for GitHub, Unspace Interactive, and KL Group/Sitraka, where I was the JProbe Threadalyzer TPM and JProbe Suite GPM.

I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my cross-group technical and product-focused experience, within a growing and rapidly iterating organization that shares my aspiration to change the world.

### this is not my first rodeo

I have shipped a lot of software. I know how to ship, and I am familiar with many things that can threaten shipping, and some of the ways to effectively navigate past the obstacles. I know how engineering and product teams evolve with growth and organizational maturity, and some of the ways to maintain the best and most effective parts of a culture while helping to evolve the parts that no longer serve the mission. I am a senior engineer with forty years of product- and customer-centric business and technical experience. A steady veteran who can be relied upon to maintain calm and focus, suppressing uncertainty and maximizing optionality during rapidly evolving circumstances.

## What I believe

- I believe that all software is social software. I believe that to thrive, software must become the comunications medium or load-bearing source of truth for a critical process.  

- I believe that improving productivity is the [faster horses] of enterprise software. I believe that transforming the way customers think about their work, communicate about their work, and do their work is fundamental to creating and dominating entirely new markets.

## What I do

### I am technical

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">“<em>Reg hired me as a senior developer to work
on a new product. Reg led the team and did
all the high-level design. Since the team was
small and the timeframe short, Reg was also
coding a good portion of the product.
Over that time I obviously had a great deal
of contact with Reg's design and his code,
and both were excellent. The project was
completed on time and was successful.</em>”</p> 
<div style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">—John MacMillan: Software Architect, IBM Canada Research Lab</div>

I have designed and built software for paying customers since the 1990s:

- In the early 90s, I wrote and sold a Classified Advertising Management application for Desktop Publishers.  

- In 1994, I shipped [nCrypt Light], a message encryption tool for the Apple Newton.  

- In the 2000s, I was the hands-on Technical Product Manager for [JProbe Threadalyzer], the first tool to perform predictive and actual deadlock and data race detection on Java servers.

- I led the web banking team for ING Direct (USA), with more than three million active users. I personally wrote features such as its first ATM and Café locator.[^ing]  

- As a member of GitHub's documentation tools and front-end flow teams in the early 2010s, I shipped features such as [Rich Prose Diffs].[^more]    

- Since 2015 as the Principal Engineer for Incident Management, I was PagerDuty's hands-on lead for the [insights] and [operational review] features, and the launch of features such as [response mobilizer]. I wrote prototypes for features such as [recent changes].

[^ing]: ING Direct (USA) was sold to Capital One in 2011. I learned a great deal about integration with legacy systems and Enterprise Architectural Patterns for integration with legacy systems and extending their functionality. Ask me about MUMPS and JDBC.
[^GitHub]: At GitHub, my most visible achievement was launching the [Rich Prose Diffs] feature during a Superbowl.
[^more]: I've written commercial software using Turbo Pascal, Lightspeed C, NewtonScript, C++, HyperCard, Fourth Dimension, Excel, Hypercard, Filemaker, C++, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, WebObjects, MUMPS, CoffeeScript, Backbone, Ember, React, and TypeScript; I've written commercial software on MP/M, Windows, MacintoshOS, NewtonOS, Unix, and for the last two decades, the Open Web.

### I ship products

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">“<em>Reg and I worked together for a year and a
half. During that time, he spearheaded the
effort to produce JProbe Threadalyzer, and
then shepherded the entire JProbe suite
through two subsequent upgrade releases. By
that time, Threadalyzer had all but elimi-
nated its competition in the Java thread
analysis space, and JProbe had become
KL's major source of revenue.</em>”</p>  
<div style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">—Christian Jaekl: Software Engineer and Concurrency Domain Expert</div>

My career-long focus includes the product development work *around* the technical work:

- As the Technical Product Manager for JProbe Threadalyzer, I performed technical and product research, developed the value proposition, and designed the product.  

- As the Program Manager for the JProbe Suite of products, I collaborated with Sales and Marketing Product Management on prioritization and positioning, acted as the media contact for feature-detailed interviews and demos, and manned the booth at JavaOne.  

- At Github, I refined a prototype, designed and developed the user experience, and shipped [Rich Prose Diffs].    

- At PagerDuty—working with Product Mangement and Marketing Strategy—I wrote the technical road map for the company's Scheduling and Workflow features, identifying feasible and compelling features to establish strong differentiation from compatitors and complements.  

- At PagerDuty, my teams ideated, developed, and shipped [insights] and [operational review] features, and launched [response mobilizer].

### I grow engineering

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">“<em>You were such an anchor and leader at PD! Thank you for the countless interviews, for the always interesting insights, for mentoring so many, and for shaping PD and just being a great person! You are a true PD Hall of Famer and Legend!</em>”</p>  
<div style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">—Richard Hartshorne: Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty</div>

- I've led technical interviews throughout my career and partnered with Talent on initiatives. At PagerDuty, I was recognized for using the interview process to close senior hires.    

- I've shared technical and business experience throughout my career, in person, in documentation and papers, and in technical or product presentations.

- As a member of PagerDuty's Architecture Strategy and Front-End Architecture Strategy teams, I led or co-led the adoption of tooling, process, and language choices that supported scaling engineering capacity.  

- I helped PagerDuty's engineering successfully navigate the product/market fit refinement phase, a rapid sales growth phase, and a post-IPO transition to efficient and predictible scaling phase.

### I foster collaboration

<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0px;">“<em>Extraordinary communication skills... Able to mentor and coach other engineers and make those less experienced experienced comfortable and build their confidence (empowerment) at the same time. Your communication skills transcended engineering to other parts of the businesses (Product and Executive leadership). And, it is natural leadership... Not forced in any way. You talk to, and get respect, from the Interns to the C-Level.</em>”</p>  
<div style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">—Richard Hartshorne: Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty</div>

At PagerDuty, in addition to the [product](#i-ship-products) and [engineering growth](#i-grow-engineering) outcomes above, I also collaborated across group and functional lines to:

- Support complex deployment strategies that in turn supported highly refined product management and sales tactics.  

- Ideate and prototype features and products in conjunction with proposed feature and product strategies.  

- Lead our own Incident Management practice.  

- Launch and support a more rigorous iteration of Engineering's Design Review process.  

- Launch and mannage technical and organizational reorganizations and process iterations.

I was awarded the *Breakthrough* leadership award in 2019 and the *Inclusively Leading and Learning* award in 2022. 

### I'm available for work.

I recently completed nine years as a Principal Engineer with PagerDuty, where I was part of the overall leadership while we from roughly M$25 ARR to our IPO and on to roughly M$450 ARR. I've shipped for PagerDuty, GitHub, devTopia, Unspace Interactive, and KL Group/Sitraka amongst others.

I'm available to play a meaningful part in another breakout success. I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my technical and product focus, within a growing and rapidly iterating group that shares my aspiration to change the way customers think about their business and their work.

### This is not my first rodeo

<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0px;">“<em>You were a huge asset to PagerDuty, and wherever you land next will be lucky to have you.</em>”</p>  
<div style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">—Michael Cucci: Investor, Startup Advisor, and former VP Product and Marketing, PagerDuty</div>

I bring forty years of product- and customer- centric business and technical experience to shipping on time, without drama. My teams know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."

*“<em>When we built Threadalyzer, Reg developed
the technical design, partitioned it into
manageable pieces for a group of developers,
and also wrote a significant chunk of the
code himself. Along the way, he insisted on
regular code reviews, asking appropriate and
probing questions about design decisions. I
read his code, too (he wouldn't have it any
other way), but I had a hard time finding
flaws. The result was probably the most
solid codebase that I've ever worked on.</p>

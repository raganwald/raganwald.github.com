## Who I am

*“Reg crossed role and organizational lines to constantly better the company and increase in scale our impact on the market, our products, and customers.”*  
—<span style="font-size:0.8em">Michael Cucci, Investor, Startup Advisor, and former VP Product and Marketing, PagerDuty</span>

I am technical; I ship products; and I grow engineering collaboratively. I have led teams from four to forty-five people; I've led through growth in size and complexity from startup-in-a-room to IPO and globally distributed teams; I've led engineering-wide changes to structure, process, tooling, and platforms.

I shipped the products and features responsible for KL Group/Sitraka's and PagerDuty's successful exits[^sitraka-quest][^PDNYSE]

I'm available for work, and this is not my first rodeo. I have been most impactful as a Technical Product Manager, or Staff+ Engineer with a side of TPM. I am a very strong communicator: I wrote a popular book about JavaScript, I write technical documentation and essays, and I speak at both tech conferences and company-wide events.

My experience is itemized in more detail on [LinkedIn]; my résumé is available upon [request][raganwald@gmail.com]. My books, essays, and conference talks are available on my [creative works page]. My personal email is [raganwald@gmail.com].

## What I believe

- I believe that all software is social software. I believe that to thrive, software must become the comunications medium or load-bearing source of truth for a critical process.
- I believe in systems-first thinking. I believe that human mistakes are opportunities for organizational improvement.
- I believe that "improved productivity" is the faster horses of enterprise software. I believe that transforming the way customers think about their work, communicate about their work, and do their work is fundamental to creating and dominating entirely new markets.

## What I do

### I am technical

*“Reg hired me as a senior developer to work
on a new product. Reg led the team and did
all the high-level design. Since the team was
small and the timeframe short, Reg was also
coding a good portion of the product.
Over that time I obviously had a great deal
of contact with Reg's design and his code,
and both were excellent. The project was
completed on time and was successful.*

In addition to my responsibilities as the principal engineer for Incident Management, I was PagerDuty's hands-on lead for the [insights] and [operational review] features, and the launch of [response mobilizer]. I wrote working prototypes of highly concurrent liveness, [recent changes], advanced scheduling, and other strategic functionality. I was also the hands-on technical product manager for [JProbe Threadalyzer], the first tool to perform predictive and actual deadlock and data race detection on Java servers, and in 1994, I shipped [nCrypt Light], a message encryption tool for the Apple Newton.

I've led development of web applications that manage NGOs, sales teams, live business model design, and other SMB-scale work. I've led development of ING (USA)'s web banking, and shipped features on GitHub's web flow.[^ing][^GitHub][^more]

[^GitHub]: At GitHub, my most visible achievement was launching the [Rich Prose Diffs] feature during a Superbowl.

[^more]: I've written commercial software using Turbo Pascal, Lightspeed C, NewtonScript, C++, Fourth Dimension, Excel, Hypercard, Filemaker, C++, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, WebObjects, MUMPS, CoffeeScript, Backbone, Ember, React, and TypeScript; I've written commercial software on MP/M, Windows, MacintoshOS, Unix, and for the last two decades, the open web.

### I ship products

*“Reg and I worked together for a year and a
half. During that time, he spearheaded the
effort to produce JProbe Threadalyzer, and
then shepherded the entire JProbe suite
through two subsequent upgrade releases. By
that time, Threadalyzer had all but elimi-
nated its competition in the Java thread
analysis space, and JProbe had become
KL's major source of revenue.”*

I have shipped as a Technical Product Manager, Program Manager, and in hands-on engineering roles. My work is informed by my experience consulting, in technology marketing, and in enterprise sales. I am a past-member of both the Toronto Computer-Human Interaction ACM-SIG and the Toronto Product Management Association.

I align technology, design, prioritization, process, and architecture with the capacity we have, the product we need to ship, and our product strategy. As a technical product manager, I collaborate heavily with my colleagues in Product, Engineering, and Sales, with a heavy emphasis on a culture of writing. My teams have won both the Jolt Product Excellence and Jolt Software Developer Productivity awards.

My teams know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."

[^sitraka-quest]: KL/Group/Sitraka was aquired by Quest Software in 2002.
[^PDNYSE]: PagerDuty went public on the NYSE in 2019.

### I grow engineering groups

*“You were such an anchor and leader at PD! Thank you for the countless interviews, for the always interesting insights, for mentoring so many, and for shaping PD and just being a great person! You are a true PD Hall of Famer and Legend!”*  
—<span style="font-size:0.8em">Richard Hartshorne, Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty</span>

I am a strong partner with recruiting, and I'm known both for expertise evaluating prospective engineers, and for my stength closing senior hires. I grow engineering through people, process and technology. As a founding member of PagerDuty's Architecture Strategy and Front-End Architecture Strategy teams, I co-led the adoption of tooling, processes, and programming language choices that supported scaling engineering capacity.

I understand how to manage culture, talent, and tooling for rapid product iteration and scale; how to recognize when growth and strategy trigger organizational change; and how to lead culture, talent, and tooling from the old to the new without drama.

### I lead through collaboration

*“Extraordinary communication skills... Able to mentor and coach other engineers and make those less experienced experienced comfortable and build their confidence (empowerment) at the same time. Your communication skills transcended engineering to other parts of the businesses (Product and Executive leadership). And, it is natural leadership... Not forced in any way. You talk to, and get respect, from the Interns to the C-Level.”*  
—<span style="font-size:0.8em">Richard Hartshorne, Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty</span>

I integrate my experience as a product-focused technologist into building and leading both teams and product groups. At PagerDuty, my teams focused on product delivery and refinement execution, then our focus evolved into alignment with scaling engineering capacity and cohesion across groups. I have been recognized with two leadership awards.[^awards]

[^awards]: I was awarded the Breakthrough award in 2019 for my efforts to elevate the company's product line strategically, and the Inclusively Leading and Learning award in 2022 for my work advancing the company's engineering capabilities.

## I'm available for work.

I recently completed nine years as a Principal Engineer with PagerDuty, where I was part of the leadership that took us from ~M$25 ARR to our IPO and ~M$450 ARR. I've shipped for GitHub, Unspace Interactive, and KL Group/Sitraka. I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my technical and product focus, within a growing and rapidly iterating group that shares my aspiration to change the world.

### this is not my first rodeo

*“You were a huge asset to PagerDuty, and wherever you land next will be lucky to have you.”*  
—<span style="font-size:0.8em">Michael Cucci, Investor, Startup Advisor, and former VP Product and Marketing, PagerDuty</span>

I know how to ship, how to recognize threats to shipping, and how to keep a team on track. I know how engineering and product teams evolve with growth and organizational maturity, and some of the ways to maintain the best and most effective parts of a culture while helping to evolve the parts that no longer serve the mission.

I bring forty years of product- and customer-centric business and technical experience to shipping on time, without drama.

*“When we built Threadalyzer, Reg developed
the technical design, partitioned it into
manageable pieces for a group of developers,
and also wrote a significant chunk of the
code himself. Along the way, he insisted on
regular code reviews, asking appropriate and
probing questions about design decisions. I
read his code, too (he wouldn't have it any
other way), but I had a hard time finding
flaws. The result was probably the most
solid codebase that I've ever worked on.”*

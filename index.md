## Who I Am

I am a technical product leader whose passion is making something wonderful.

_I am technical_: I write software, and I write about software. Everything I do with product design, software architecture, and leading the process of shipping software is anchored in more than forty years of shipping software that runs businesses. I've shipped products written with C++, Java, Ruby, Scala, Elixir, JavaScript, and TypeScript, using too many libraries, frameworks, and patterns to list. I also write [technical-essays], speak at [tech-conferences], and I've published several [books] about programming.

_I am product-focused_: I have shipped products as floppies, CD/DVD-ROMs, and SaaS. Prior to developing software full-time, I worked in Enterprise Sales, Consulting, and Marketing. I am a past-member of both the Toronto Computer-Human Interaction ACM-SIG and the Toronto Product Management Association. My technical and leadership work are both deeply informed by and aligned with product strategy.

_I am a technical product leader_: I have shipped software as a Technical Product Manager, Engineering Manager, Program Manager, and Principal Engineer. I integrate my experience as a product-focused technologist into leading teams and groups. In the most recent chapter of my career, I won two company leadership awards for helping our engineering force navigate the challenges of growing from a scrappy startup to a revenue monster and from there to an IPO. I work both within my direct focus and collaboratively across the product, sales, and marketing orgs to ensure we are aligned and in perfect sync on both strategy and execution. 

My passion is _making something wonderful_. Software that cuts waste, alleviates paper cuts, eliminates human error, and improves productivity is necessary, but insufficient to launch a movement that will one day change the world. I aspire to ship software that leads customers to change the way they think about the work they do. And with that transformation, comes a virtuous flywheel effect: Customers who complete their trasnformations discover new needs and opportunities, which we in turn serve as follow-on features and products.

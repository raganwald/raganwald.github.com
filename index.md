I am Reginald Braithwaite, a technical product leader passionate about collaboration in the service of making something wonderful. I have forty years of experience coding and shipping software that powers businesses. My teams know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."

I'm available for work, and this is not my first rodeo. I am highly impactful in a role that is functionally two-thirds Staff+ Engineer and one-third Technical Product Manager. I once wrote a popular book about JavaScript, I write technical documentation and essays, and I speak at both tech conferences and company-wide events.

My experience is itemized in more detail on [LinkedIn]; my résumé is available upon [request][raganwald@gmail.com]. My books, essays, and conference talks are available on my [creative works] page. I can be reached via [raganwald@gmail.com].

### I am technical

I was the hands-on technical product manager for [JProbe Threadalyzer], the first product to analyze running Java programs and perform predictive and actual deadlock and data race detection. I've written web applications that manage NGOs, sales teams, live business model design, and other SMB-scale work. I've worked at global scale, as team lead for ING (USA)'s web banking, on GitHub's web flow, and at PagerDuty.[^ing][^GitHub]

[^ing]: ING Direct (USA) was sold to Capital One in 2011.
[^GitHub]: At GitHub, my most visible achievement was launching the [Rich Prose Diffs] feature during a Superbowl.

[Rich Prose Diffs]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files#rendering-differences-in-prose-documents

At PagerDuty, I was the hands-on lead for the [insights] and [operational review] features, and the launch of [response mobilizer]. I wrote working prototypes of highly concurrent liveness, [recent changes], advanced scheduling, and other strategic functionality; I handled critical incidents as an Incident Commander, wrote technical product road maps, and collaborated across product group lines to develop, review, and implement engineering-wide technical standards and transitions.

I've merged code written in C++, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Ember, React, TypeScript, and more.[^more]

[^more]: I've written commerical software using Turbo Pascal, Lightspeed C, C++, Fourth Dimension, Excel, Hypercard, Filemaker, C++, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, WebObjects, MUMPS, CoffeeScript, Backbone, Ember, React, and TypeScript; I've written commercial software on MP/M, Windows, MacintoshOS, Unix, and for the last two decades, the web.

### I ship products

I have shipped as a Technical Product Manager, Program Manager, and in hands-on engineering roles. My work is informed by my professional experience in consulting, technology marketing, and enterprise sales. I am a past-member of both the Toronto Computer-Human Interaction ACM-SIG and the Toronto Product Management Association.

 I align technology, design, prioritization, process, and architecture with the capacity we have, the product we need to ship, and our product strategy. As a technical product manager, I collaborate heavily with my colleagues in Product, Engineering, and Sales, with a heavy emphasis on a culture of writing. The products I shipped have led to exits for KL Group/Sitraka and PagerDuty.[^sitraka-quest][^PDNYSE]

[^sitraka-quest]: KL/Group/Sitraka was aquired by Quest Software in 2002.
[^PDNYSE]: PagerDuty went public on the NYSE in 2019.

### I lead through collaboration

> Extraordinary communication skills...able to mentor and coach other engineers and make those less experienced experienced comfortable and build their confidence (empowerment) at the same time. Your communication skills transcended engineering to other parts of the businesses (Product and Executive leadership). And, it is natural leadership...not forced in any way. You talk to, and get respect, from the Interns to the C-Level.  
—RH, Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty

I integrate my experience as a product-focused technologist into building and leading both teams and product groups. At PagerDuty, my teams focused on product delivery and refinement execution, then our focus evolved into alignment with scaling engineering capacity and cohesion across groups. I have been recognized with two leadership awards.[^awards]

[^awards]: I was awarded the Breakthrough award in 2019 for my efforts to elevate the company's product line strategically, and the Inclusively Leading and Learning award in 2022 for my work advancing the company's engineering capabilities. 

### My passion is making something wonderful

My belief is that software that cuts waste, eliminates errors, and improves productivity is necessary, but insufficient to launch a movement that will one day change the world. I aspire to collaboratively ship software that leads customers to change the way they think about the work they do.

I believe in the virtuous flywheel effect: Customers who change the way they work discover new needs and opportunities, which we in turn serve with follow-on features and products.

### I grow engineering

> You were such an anchor and leader at PD! Thank you for the countless interviews, for the always interesting insights, for mentoring so many, and for shaping PD and just being a great person! You are a true PD Hall of Famer and Legend!  
—RH, Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty

I am a strong partner with recruiting, and I'm known both for expertise evaluating prospective engineers, and for my stength closing senior hires. I grow engineering through people, process and technology. As a founding member of PagerDuty's Architecture Strategy and Front-End Architecture Strategy teams, I co-led the adoption of tooling, processes, and programming language choices that supported scaling engineering capacity.

I understand how to manage culture, talent, and tooling for rapid product iteration and scale; how to recognize when growth and strategy trigger organizational change; and how to lead culture, talent, and tooling from the old to the new without drama.

### I am available for work.

I recently completed nine years as a Principal Engineer with PagerDuty, where I was part of the leadership that took us from ~M$25 ARR to our IPO and ~M$450 ARR. I've shipped for GitHub, Unspace Interactive, and KL Group/Sitraka. I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my technical and product focus, within a growing and rapidly iterating group that shares my aspiration to change the world.

### this is not my first rodeo

> You were a huge asset to \[PagerDuty,\] and wherever you land next will be lucky to have you.  
> —MC, Investor, Startup Advisor, and former VP Product and Marketing, PagerDuty

I know how to ship, how to recognize threats to shipping, and how to keep a team on track. I know how engineering and product teams evolve with growth and organizational maturity, and some of the ways to maintain the best and most effective parts of a culture while helping to evolve the parts that no longer serve the mission.

I bring forty years of product- and customer-centric business and technical experience to shipping on time, without drama.

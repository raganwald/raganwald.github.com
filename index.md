## Who I Am

I am [technical](#i-am-technical). I ship [products](#i-ship-products). I lead [engineering growth](#i-lead-engineering-growth). And I foster [collaboration](#i-foster-collaboration). This is [not my first rodeo](#this-is-not-my-first-rodeo), and I'm [available for work](#im-available-for-work).

- I have led teams from four to forty-five people; I've led through growth in size and complexity from startup to IPO and globally distributed teams; I've led engineering-wide changes to structure, process, tooling, and platforms.<br/><br/>
- I wrote a respected [book](/creative-works.html#books) about JavaScript; I write technical documentation and essays; and I speak at both tech conferences and company-wide events.<sup id="fnref:creative-works" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:creative-works" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br/><br/>
- I shipped products and features that contributed to KL Group/Sitraka's and PagerDuty's successful exits.<sup id="fnref:sitraka-quest" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sitraka-quest" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:PDNYSE" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:PDNYSE" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>

## What I Believe

- I believe that all software is social software. I believe that to thrive, software must become the comunications medium or load-bearing source of truth for a critical process.<br/><br/>
- I believe that improving productivity is the [faster horses] of enterprise software. I believe that transforming the way customers think about their work, communicate with each other about their work, and do their work together is fundamental to creating and dominating entirely new markets.

## What I Do

### I am technical

<!-- <p style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">“<em>Reg hired me as a senior developer to work
on a new product. Reg led the team and did
all the high-level design. Since the team was
small and the timeframe short, Reg was also
coding a good portion of the product.
Over that time I obviously had a great deal
of contact with Reg's design and his code,
and both were excellent. The project was
completed on time and was successful.</em>”</p> 
<p style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">—John MacMillan: Software Architect, IBM Canada Research Lab</p> -->

<p style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">“<em>Reg was always my ‘secret weapon’ for getting a new initiative off the ground. He understood our code and our product and what it was capable of, and he understood our customers and their needs.</em></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">“<em>Reg was exceptional at translating a product manager’s vision for a new feature into an actionable technical plan and architecture given all of the constraints inherent in adapting working software to new capabilities, then getting the rest of the team on-board and executing.</em>”</p>  
<p style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">—Jason Diller: VP of Engineering, Georgias and former Director of Engineering, PagerDuty</p>

I have designed and built software for paying customers since the 1990s:

- In the early 90s, I wrote and sold Tableau, classified advertising management for desktop publishers.<sup id="fnref:tableau" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:tableau" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><br/><br/>
- In 1994, I shipped [nCrypt Light], a message encryption tool for the Apple Newton.<br/><br/>
- In the early 2000s, I was the hands-on Technical Product Manager for [JProbe Threadalyzer], the first tool to perform predictive and actual deadlock and data race detection on Java servers.<br/><br/>
- As Program Manager for the [JProbe Suite], I wrote a little code, such as designing and shipping the suite's first configuration tool.<br/><br/>
- In the mid 2000s, I led the web banking team for [ING Direct (USA)][ING], with more than three million active users. I personally wrote features such as its first ATM and Café locator. I used Enterprise Architectural Patterns for integration with legacy systems and extending their functionality.<sup id="fnref:mumps" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mumps" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup><br/><br/>
- As a member of GitHub's documentation tools and front-end flow teams in the early 2010s, I shipped features such as [rich prose diffs].<br/><br/>
- In 2015, I was hired as the Principal Engineer for Incident Management. I was PagerDuty's hands-on lead for the [insights] and [operational review] features, and the launch of features such as [response mobilizer]. I wrote prototypes for features such as [recent changes].

### I ship products

<p style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">“<em>Reg and I worked together for a year and a half. During that time, he spearheaded the effort to produce JProbe Threadalyzer, and then shepherded the entire JProbe suite through two subsequent upgrade releases. By that time, Threadalyzer had all but eliminated its competition in the Java thread analysis space, and JProbe had become KL's major source of revenue.</em>”</p>  
<p style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">—Christian Jaekl: Software Engineer and Concurrency Domain Expert</p>

My career-long focus is the complete product strategy and development workflow around the technical work:

- As the Technical Product Manager for JProbe Threadalyzer, I performed user research, developed the value proposition, and designed the product.<br/><br/>
- As the Program Manager for the JProbe Suite, I collaborated with Sales and Marketing Product Management on prioritization and positioning, acted as the media contact for feature-detailed interviews and demos, and manned the booth at JavaOne.<br/><br/>
- At Github, I created the prose-specific heuristics, designed and developed the user experience, and shipped [rich prose diffs].<br/><br/>
- At PagerDuty—working with Product Mangement and Marketing Strategy—I wrote the technical road map for the company's Scheduling and Workflow features, identifying feasible and compelling features to establish strong differentiation from compatitors and complements.<br/><br/>
- At PagerDuty, my teams ideated, developed, and shipped [insights] and [operational review] features, and launched [response mobilizer]. Ask me about [schedules].

### I lead engineering growth

<p style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">“<em>You were such an anchor and leader at PD! Thank you for the countless interviews, for the always interesting insights, for mentoring so many, and for shaping PD and just being a great person! You are a true PD Hall of Famer and Legend!</em>”</p>  
<p style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">—Richard Hartshorne: Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty</p>

- I've led technical interviews throughout my career and partnered with Talent on initiatives. At PagerDuty, I was recognized for using the interview process to close senior hires.<br/><br/>
- As a member of PagerDuty's Architecture Strategy and Front-End Architecture Strategy teams, I led or co-led the adoption of tooling, process, and language choices that supported scaling engineering capacity.<br/><br/>
- I helped PagerDuty's engineering successfully navigate the product/market fit refinement phase, a rapid sales growth phase, and a post-IPO transition to efficient and predictible scaling phase.<sup id="fnref:pd-growth" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pd-growth" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>

### I foster collaboration

<p style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">“<em>Reg crossed role and organizational lines to constantly better the company and increase in scale our impact on the market, our products, and customers.</em>”</p>  
<p style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">—Michael Cucci: Investor, Startup Advisor, and former VP Product and Marketing, PagerDuty</p>

At PagerDuty, in addition to the [product](#i-ship-products) and [engineering growth](#i-lead-engineering-growth) outcomes above, I also collaborated across group and functional lines:

- I was awarded PagerDuty's *Breakthrough* leadership award in 2019 and the *Inclusively Leading and Learning* award in 2022.<br/><br/>
- I developed an internal capability supporting refined product management shipping strategies.<br/><br/>
- I ideated and prototyped features and products in partnership with my Product and Leadership colleagues.<br/><br/>
- I led our own Incident Management practice.<br/><br/>
- I have MC'd the company's annual kickoff, and co-hosted the company's [IPO Breakfast Party](/assets/images/ipo-breakfast.jpg).<br/><br/>
- I launched and supported a more rigorous iteration of Engineering's Design Review process.<br/><br/>
- I launched and led technical and organizational reorganizations and process iterations.

## What's Next?

### This is not my first rodeo

<p style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">“<em>Extraordinary communication skills... Able to mentor and coach other engineers and make those less experienced experienced comfortable and build their confidence (empowerment) at the same time. Your communication skills transcended engineering to other parts of the businesses (Product and Executive leadership). And, it is natural leadership... Not forced in any way. You talk to, and get respect, from the Interns to the C-Level.</em>”</p>  
<p style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">—Richard Hartshorne: Senior Talent Partner, PagerDuty</p>

I bring forty years of product- and customer- centric business and technical experience to shipping on time, without drama. My teams know how to ship "good" without being seduced by "sufficient" or derailed by "perfect."

### I'm available for work.

<p style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">“<em>You were a huge asset to PagerDuty, and wherever you land next will be lucky to have you.</em>”</p>  
<p style="font-size:0.8em; text-align:right; margin: 0px 20px 20px 20px;">—Michael Cucci: Investor, Startup Advisor, and former VP Product and Marketing, PagerDuty</p>

I recently completed nine years as a Principal Engineer with PagerDuty. I've shipped for PagerDuty, GitHub, devTopia, Unspace Interactive, and KL Group/Sitraka amongst others. I'm available to play a meaningful part in another breakout success.

I'm open to 100% remote or Greater Toronto Area hybrid roles that leverage my technical and product focus.
